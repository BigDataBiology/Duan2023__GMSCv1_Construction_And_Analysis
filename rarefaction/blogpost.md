# Global Microbial Small ORFs Catalog - Gene rarefaction for smORFs

## Abstract 

- cite number of unique smorfs for the rarefaction

## Distribution of the small Open Reading Frames

There are millions of Open Reading Frames (ORFs) spread through the genomes from diverse habitats that, if they were translated, would generate much smaller proteins made of fewer than 100 amino acids. In this context, we have the small ORFs (smORFs), which have the vast majority of functions still unknown, although previous studies collected and annotated a considerable number of smORFs [1, 2].

As its functions, little is known about the distribution of smORFs across different environments.
