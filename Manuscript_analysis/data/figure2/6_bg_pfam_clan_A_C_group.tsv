In the absence of arabinose, the N-terminal arm of AraC binds to the DNA binding domain (pfam00165) and helps to hold the two DNA binding domains in a relative orientation that favours DNA looping. In the presence of arabinose, the arms bind over the arabinose on the dimerization domain, thus freeing the DNA-binding domains. The freed DNA-binding domains are then able to assume a conformation suitable for binding to the adjacent DNA sites that are utilized when AraC activates transcription, and hence AraC ceases looping the DNA when arabinose is added.	42	CL0123	Bacterial regulatory helix-turn-helix proteins, AraC family	Helix-turn-helix clan

YoeB_toxin is a family of bacterial toxins that forms one component of the type II toxin-antitoxin system in E. coli whose antitoxin is represented by YefM, found in pfam02604. The plasmid encoded Axe-Txe proteins in Enterococcus faecium act as an antitoxin-toxin pair. When the plasmid is lost, the antitoxin is degraded relatively quickly by host enzymes. This allows the toxin to interact with its intracellular target, thus killing the cell or impeding cell growth. These toxins are highly potent protein synthesis inhibitors, specifically blocking the initiation of translation. In the case of YoeB, it binds to the 50 S ribosomal subunit in 70 S ribosomes and interacts with the A site leading to mRNA cleavage at this site. As a result, the 3'-end portion of the mRNA is released from ribosomes, and translation initiation is effectively inhibited.	80	CL0136	YoeB-like toxin of bacterial type II toxin-antitoxin system	Plasmid toxin-antitoxin system

Both yeast and human Sdh5/SDHAF2 interact with the catalytic subunit of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex, a component of both the electron transport chain and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Sdh5 is required for SDH-dependent respiration and for Sdh1 flavination (incorporation of the flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor). Mutational inactivation of Sdh5 confers tumor susceptibility in humans. Bacterial homologs of Sdh5, termed SdhE, are functionally conserved being required for the flavinylation of SdhA and succinate dehydrogenase activity. Like Sdh5, SdhE interacts with SdhA. Furthermore, SdhE was characterized as a FAD co-factor chaperone that directly binds FAD to facilitate the flavinylation of SdhA. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that SdhE/Sdh5 proteins evolved only once in an ancestral alpha-proteobacteria prior to the evolution of the mitochondria and now remain in subsequent descendants including eukaryotic mitochondria and the alpha, beta and gamma proteobacteria. This family was previously annotated in Pfam as being a divergent TPR repeat but structural evidence has indicated this is not true.

01985			426547	14222	0.000252902807470118	CRS1_YhbY	CRS1 / YhbY (CRM) domain. Escherichia coli YhbY is associated with pre-50S ribosomal subunits, which implies a function in ribosome assembly. GFP fused to a single-domain CRM protein from maize localizes to the nucleolus, suggesting that an analogous activity may have been retained in plants. A CRM domain containing protein in plant chloroplasts has been shown to function in group I and II intron splicing. In vitro experiments with an isolated maize CRM domain have shown it to have RNA binding activity. These and other results suggest that the CRM domain evolved in the context of ribosome function prior to the divergence of Archaea and Bacteria, that this function has been maintained in extant prokaryotes, and that the domain was recruited to serve as an RNA binding module during the evolution of plant genomes. YhbY has a fold similar to that of the C-terminal domain of translation initiation factor 3 (IF3C), which binds to 16S rRNA in the 30S ribosome.	81		CRS1 / YhbY (CRM) domain	CRS1 / YhbY (CRM) domain
13376			433158	14043	0.0002497197388062767	OmdA	Bacteriocin-protection, YdeI or OmpD-Associated. This is a family of archaeal and bacterial proteins predicted to be periplasmic. YdeI is important for resistance to polymyxin B in broth and for bacterial survival in mice upon oral, but not intraperitoneal inoculation, suggesting a role for YdeI in the gastrointestinal tract of mice. Production of the ydeI gene is regulated by the Rcs (regulator of capsule synthesis) phospho-relay system pathway independently of RcsA, and additionally transcription of the protein is regulated by the stationary-phase sigma factor, RpoS (sigma-S). YdeI confers protection against cationic AMPs (Antimicrobial peptides) or bacteriocins in conjunction with the general porin Omp, thus justifying its name of OmdA, for OmpD-Associated protein.	60		Bacteriocin-protection, YdeI or OmpD-Associated	Bacteriocin-protection

Members of this family are all membrane bound proteins possessing a pair of repeats each spanning two transmembrane helices connected by a loop. The PQ motif found on loop 2 is critical for the localization of cystinosin to lysosomes. However, the PQ motif appears not to be a general lysosome-targeting motif. It is thought likely to possess a more general function. Most probably this involves a glutamine residue. Family members are membrane transporters since two members, cystinosin and PQLC2, transport cystine and cationic amino acids, respectively, across the lysosomal membrane. The 2nd PQ-loop of cystinosin hosts the substrate-coupled H+ binding site underlying its H+ symport mechanism, suggesting that PQ-loop repeats have functional significance. It is thus likely that PQ-loop-containing proteins act as a family of membrane transporters. Some transport cystine and cationic amino acids, respectively, across the lysosomal membrane. Others transport lysine and or arginine across the lysosomal membrane in order to maintain the acidic homoeostasis.	61	CL0141	PQ loop repeat	MtN3-like, vesicle-trafficking cargo-receptors

Inhibition of sigma 28 prevents the expression of genes from flagellar transcriptional class 3, which include genes for the filament and chemotaxis. Correctly assembled basal body-hook structures export FlgM, relieving inhibition of sigma 28 and allowing expression of class 3 genes. NMR studies show that free FlgM is mostly unfolded, which may facilitate its export. The C terminal half of FlgM adopts a tertiary structure when it binds to sigma 28. All mutations in FlgM that prevent sigma 28 inhibition affect the C-terminal domain and is the region thought to constitute the binding domain. A minimal binding domain has been identified between Glu 64 and Arg 88 in Salmonella typhimurium.

The C-terminal domain is crucial for providing the extra cysteine necessary for dimerization of the whole molecule. Loss of the enzyme's peroxidase activity is associated with oxidation of the catalytic cysteine, upstream of this domain; and glutathionylation, presumably through its disruption of protein structure, facilitates access for GSH, resulting in spontaneous reduction of the mixed disulfide to the sulfhydryl and consequent activation of the enzyme.

The domain consists of six alpha helices containing a four-helix bundle-folding. The pattern of sequence similarity of the HPt domains of ArcB and components in other signaling systems can be interpreted in light of the three-dimensional structure and supports the conclusion that the HPt domains have a common structural motif both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

This family consists of several bacterial MobC-like, mobilisation proteins. MobC proteins belong to the group of relaxases. Together with MobA and MobB they bind to a single cis-active site of a mobilising plasmid, the origin of transfer (oriT) region. The absence of MobC has several different effects on oriT DNA. Site- and strand-specific nicking by MobA protein is severely reduced, accounting for the lower frequency of mobilisation. The localized DNA strand separation required for this nicking is less affected, but becomes more sensitive to the level of active DNA gyrase in the cell. In addition, strand separation is not efficiently extended through the region containing the nick site. These effects suggest a model in which MobC acts as a molecular wedge for the relaxosome-induced melting of oriT DNA. The effect of MobC on strand separation may be partially complemented by the helical distortion induced by supercoiling. However, MobC extends the melted region through the nick site, thus providing the single-stranded substrate required for cleavage by MobA.	45	CL0057	Bacterial mobilisation protein (MobC)	MetJ/Arc repressor, antitoxin of TA systems superfamily

This family has an alpha/beta topology, with 13 conserved hydrophobic residues at its core and a putative active site containing a highly conserved cysteine. Members of this family are involved in a range of physiological functions. The family includes PaaJ (PhaH) from Pseudomonas putida. PaaJ forms a complex with PaaG (PhaF), PaaI (PhaG) and PaaK (PhaI), which hydroxylates phenylacetic acid to 2-hydroxyphenylacetic acid. It also includes PaaD from Escherichia coli, a member of a multicomponent oxygenase involved in phenylacetyl-CoA hydroxylation. Furthermore, several members of this family are shown to be involved in iron-sulfur (FeS) cluster assembly. Iron-sulfur (FeS) clusters are inorganic co-factors that are are able to transfer electrons and act as catalysts. They are involved in diverse cellular processes including cellular respiration, DNA replication and repair, antibiotic resistance, and dinitrogen fixation. The biogenesis of such clusters from elemental iron and sulfur is an enzymatic process that requires a set of specialized proteins. Proteins containing this domain include the chloroplast protein HCF101 (high chlorophyll fluorescence 101), which has been described as an essential and specific factor for assembly of [4Fe-4S]-cluster-containing protein complexes such as the membrane complex Photosystem I (PSI) and the heterodimeric FTR (ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase) complex and is involved in the assembly of [4Fe-4S] clusters and their transfer to apoproteins. The mature HCF101 protein contains an N-terminal DUF59 domain as well as eight cysteine residues along the sequence. All cysteine residues are conserved among higher plants, but of the two cysteine residues located in the DUF59 domain only Cys128 is highly conserved and is present in the highly conserved P-loop domain of the plant HCF101 (CKGGVGKS). SufT protein from Staphylococcus aureus is composed of DUF59 solely and is shown to be involved in the maturation of FeS proteins. Given all this data, it is hypothesized that DUF59 might play a role in FeS cluster assembly.	72	CL0232	Iron-sulfur cluster assembly protein	NifU C-terminal domain-like superfamily

02517	Peptidase_U	Peptidase clan U	426811	6934	0.00012330390008422152	Abi	CAAX protease self-immunity. Members of this family are probably proteases (after a isoprenyl group is attached to the Cys residue in the C-terminal CAAX motif of a protein to attach it to the membrane, the AAX tripeptide being removed by one of the CAAX prenyl proteases). The family contains the CAAX prenyl protease. The proteins contain a highly conserved Glu-Glu motif at the amino end of the alignment. The alignment also contains two histidine residues that may be involved in zinc binding. While they are involved in membrane anchoring of proteins in eukaryotes, little is known about their function in prokaryotes. In some known bacteriocin loci, Abi genes have been found downstream of bacteriocin structural genes where they are probably involved in self-immunity. Investigation of the bacteriocin-like loci in the Gram positive bacteria locus from Lactobacillus sakei 23K confirmed that the bacteriocin-like genes (sak23Kalphabeta) exhibited antimicrobial activity when expressed in a heterologous host and that the associated Abi gene (sak23Ki) conferred immunity against the cognate bacteriocin. Interestingly, the immunity genes from three similar systems conferred a high degree of cross-immunity against each other's bacteriocins, suggesting the recognition of a common receptor. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that the conserved motifs constituting the putative proteolytic active site of the Abi proteins are essential for the immunity function of Sak23Ki - thus a new concept in self-immunity.	92	CL0472	Type II CAAX prenyl endopeptidase Rce1-like	Peptidase clan U

PLD produces phosphatidic acid from phosphatidylcholine, which may be essential for the formation of certain types of transport vesicles or may be constitutive vesicular transport to signal transduction pathways. PC-hydrolysing PLD is a homolog of cardiolipin synthase, phosphatidylserine synthase, bacterial PLDs, and viral proteins. Each of these appears to possess a domain duplication which is apparent by the presence of two motifs containing well-conserved histidine, lysine, and/or asparagine residues which may contribute to the active site. aspartic acid. An E. coli endonuclease (nuc) and similar proteins appear to be PLD homologs but possess only one of these motifs.

From comparative and other structural studies of the Structure 2L7K, UniProtKB:Q18AW3, it has been suggested that this family is required for interacting with other proteins in order to facilitate the transfer of the transposon CTn4 between different bacterial species. Structure 2L7K comprises an alpha-helical fold of four alpha-helices leading to the production of two clefts, the larger of which displays two highly conserved residues in close proximity, Glu-8 and Lys-48.

Collagens are generally extracellular structural proteins involved in formation of connective tissue structure. The alignment contains 20 copies of the G-X-Y repeat that forms a triple helix. The first position of the repeat is glycine, the second and third positions can be any residue but are frequently proline and hydroxy-proline. Collagens are post translationally modified by proline hydroxylase to form the hydroxy-proline residues. Defective hydroxylation is the cause of scurvy.

The crystal structure of two of these members shows that this domain has a ferredoxin like fold and is likely to exists as at least homodimers. Sulphate ions are are located at the dimer interfaces, which are thought to confer additional stability. Although the function of this domain remains to be identified, its structure suggests a role in protein-protein interactions possibly regulated by the binding of small-molecule ligands. Solution of the structure of the hyperthermophilic anaerobic Thermotoga maritima sequence, UniProtKB:Q9WYV6, shows that this has a beta-alpha-beta-beta-alpha-beta ferredoxin-like fold and assembles as a homotetramer. It was possible to identify a pocket in each monmer that bound an unidentified ligand. It was also found that it bound charged thiamine though not hydroxymethyl pyrimidine. It is proposed that it is transporting charged thiamine around the cytoplasm. Under oxidative conditions this bacterium is under stress, and the transcriiptional unit within which this protein is expressed is up-regulated in these conditions, suggesting that the chelation of cytoplasmic thaimine is part of the response mechanism to such oxidatvie stress, which is mediated by this family.	92	CL0360	Thiamine-binding protein	MTH1187/YkoF-like superfamily

10576			431367	5228	9.296694399196856e-05	EndIII_4Fe-2S	Iron-sulfur binding domain of endonuclease III. Escherichia coli endonuclease III (EC 4.2.99.18) is a DNA repair enzyme that acts both as a DNA N-glycosylase, removing oxidized pyrimidines from DNA, and as an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease, introducing a single-strand nick at the site from which the damaged base was removed. Endonuclease III is an iron-sulfur protein that binds a single 4Fe-4S cluster. The 4Fe-4S cluster does not seem to be important for catalytic activity, but is probably involved in the proper positioning of the enzyme along the DNA strand. The 4Fe-4S cluster is bound by four cysteines which are all located in a 17 amino acid region at the C-terminal end of endonuclease III. A similar region is also present in the central section of mutY and in the C-terminus of ORF-10 and of the Micro-coccus UV endonuclease.	17		Iron-sulfur binding domain of endonuclease III	Iron-sulfur binding domain of endonuclease III

It was recently shown that Mycobacterium tuberculosis contains a small protein, Pup (Rv2111c), that is covalently conjugated to the e-NH2 groups of lysines on several target proteins (pupylation) such as the malonyl CoA acyl carrier protein (FabD). Pupylation of FabD was shown to result in its recruitment to the mycobacterial proteasome and subsequent degradation analogous to eukaryotic ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. Searches recovered Pup orthologs in all major actinobacteria lineages including the basal bifidobacteria and also sporadically in certain other bacterial lineages. The Pup proteins were all between 50-90 residues in length and a multiple alignment shows that they all contain a conserved motif with a G [EQ] signature at the C-terminus. Thus, all of them are suitable for conjugation via the terminal glutamate or the deamidated glutamine (as shown in the case of the Mycobacterium Pup). The conserved globular core of Pup is predicted to form a bihelical unit with the extreme C-terminal 6-7 residues forming a tail in the extended conformation. Thus, Pup is structurally unrelated to the ubiquitin fold and has convergently evolved the function of protein modifier.	64		Pup-like protein	Pup-like protein

Members of this family strongly co-occur in two distinct gene neighborhood contexts. In one it is associated with a START domain protein, a membrane protein SmpA and the transfer mRNA binding protein SmpB. This association suggests a possible role in the SmpB-tmRNA-based tagging and degadation system of bacteria, which is interesting given that other members of the ubiquitin system are analogously involved in protein-tagging and degradation across eukaryotes and various prokaryotes. The second context in which the RnfH genes are present is in a membrane associated complex involved in transporting electrons for various reductive reactions such as nitrogen fixation.	83	CL0072	RnfH family Ubiquitin	Ubiquitin superfamily

The small ubiquitin-related modifier SUMO-1 is a Ub/Ubl family member, and although SUMO-1 shares structural similarity to Ub, SUMO's cellular functions remain distinct insomuch as SUMO modification alters protein function through changes in activity, cellular localization, or by protecting substrates from ubiquitination. Rad60 family members contain functionally enigmatic, integral SUMO-like domains (SLDs). Despite their divergence from SUMO, each Rad60 SLD interacts with a subset of SUMO pathway enzymes: SLD2 specifically binds the SUMO E2 conjugating enzyme (Ubc9)), whereas SLD1 binds the SUMO E1 (Fub2, also called Uba2) activating and E3 (Pli1, also called Siz1 and Siz2) specificity enzymes. Structural analysis of Structure 2uyz reveals a mechanistic basis for the near-synonymous roles of Rad60 and SUMO in survival of genotoxic stress and suggest unprecedented DNA-damage-response functions for SLDs in regulating SUMOylation. The Rad60 branch of this family is also known as RENi (Rad60-Esc2-Nip45), and biologically it should be two distinct families SUMO and RENi (Rad60-Esc2-Nip45).	72	CL0072	Ubiquitin-2 like Rad60 SUMO-like	Ubiquitin superfamily

This family of ribosomal proteins consists mainly of the 40S ribosomal protein S27a which is synthesized as a C-terminal extension of ubiquitin (CEP). The S27a domain compromises the C-terminal half of the protein. The synthesis of ribosomal proteins as extensions of ubiquitin promotes their incorporation into nascent ribosomes by a transient metabolic stabilisation and is required for efficient ribosome biogenesis. The ribosomal extension protein S27a contains a basic region that is proposed to form a zinc finger; its fusion gene is proposed as a mechanism to maintain a fixed ratio between ubiquitin necessary for degrading proteins and ribosomes a source of proteins.	43	CL0167	Ribosomal protein S27a	Ribosomal protein

The YukD protein family members participate in the formation of a translocon required for the secretion of WXG100 proteins (pfam06013) in monoderm bacteria, with the WXG100 protein secretion system (Wss). Like the cytoplasmic protein EsaC in Staphylococcus aureus, YukD was hypothesized to play a role of a chaperone. YukD adopts a ubiquitin-like fold. Usually, ubiquitin covalently binds to protein and flags them for protein degradation, however conjugation assays have indicated that the classical YukD lacks the capacity for covalent bond formation with other proteins. In contrast to the situation in firmicutes, YukD-like proteins in actinobacteria are often fused to a transporter involved in the ESAT-6/ESX/Wss secretion pathway. Members of the YukD family are also associated in gene neighborhoods with other enzymatic members of the ubiquitin signaling and degradation pathway such as the E1, E2 and E3 trienzyme complex that catalyze ubiquitin transfer to substrates, and the JAB family metallopeptidases that are involved in its release. This suggests that a subset of the YukD family in bacteria are conjugated and released from proteins as in the eukaryotic ubiquitin-mediated signaling and degradation pathway.	77	CL0072	WXG100 protein secretion system (Wss), protein YukD	Ubiquitin superfamily

This family consists of several eukaryotic transcription elongation Spt4 proteins as well as archaebacterial RpoE2. Three transcription-elongation factors Spt4, Spt5, and Spt6 are conserved among eukaryotes and are essential for transcription via the modulation of chromatin structure. Spt4 and Spt5 are tightly associated in a complex, while the physical association of the Spt4-Spt5 complex with Spt6 is considerably weaker. It has been demonstrated that Spt4, Spt5, and Spt6 play roles in transcription elongation in both yeast and humans including a role in activation by Tat. It is known that Spt4, Spt5, and Spt6 are general transcription-elongation factors, controlling transcription both positively and negatively in important regulatory and developmental roles. RpoE2 is one of 13 subunits in the archaeal RNA polymerase. These proteins contain a C4-type zinc finger, and the structure has been solved in. The structure reveals that Spt4-Spt5 binding is governed by an acid-dipole interaction between Spt5 and Spt4, and the complex binds to and travels along the elongating RNA polymerase. The Spt4-Spt5 complex is likely to be an ancient, core component of the transcription elongation machinery.	77	CL0167	Spt4/RpoE2 zinc finger	Zinc beta-ribbon

Cyanobacteria and red algae harvest light energy using macromolecular complexes known as phycobilisomes (PBS), peripherally attached to the photosynthetic membrane. The major components of PBS are the phycobiliproteins. These heterodimeric proteins are covalently attached to phycobilins: open-chain tetrapyrrole chromophores, which function as the photosynthetic light-harvesting pigments. Phycobiliproteins differ in sequence and in the nature and number of attached phycobilins to each of their subunits. This family includes the lyase enzymes that specifically attach particular phycobilins to apophycobiliprotein subunits. The most comprehensively studied of these is the CpcE/F lyase, which attaches phycocyanobilin (PCB) to the alpha subunit of apophycocyanin. Similarly, MpeU/V attaches phycoerythrobilin to phycoerythrin II, while CpeY/Z is thought to be involved in phycoerythrobilin (PEB) attachment to phycoerythrin (PE) I (PEs I and II differ in sequence and in the number of attached molecules of PEB: PE I has five, PE II has six). All the reactions of the above lyases involve an apoprotein cysteine SH addition to a terminal delta 3,3'-double bond. Such a reaction is not possible in the case of phycoviolobilin (PVB), the phycobilin of alpha-phycoerythrocyanin (alpha-PEC). It is thought that in this case, PCB, not PVB, is first added to apo-alpha-PEC, and is then isomerized to PVB. The addition reaction has been shown to occur in the presence of either of the components of alpha-PEC-PVB lyase PecE or PecF (or both). The isomerisation reaction occurs only when both PecE and PecF components are present, i.e. the PecE/F phycobiliprotein lyase is also a phycobilin isomerase. Another member of this family is the NblB protein, whose similarity to the phycobiliprotein lyases was previously noted. This constitutively expressed protein is not known to have any lyase activity. It is thought to be involved in the coordination of PBS degradation with environmental nutrient limitation. It has been suggested that the similarity of NblB to the phycobiliprotein lyases is due to the ability to bind tetrapyrrole phycobilins via the common repeated motif.	27	CL0020	PBS lyase HEAT-like repeat	Tetratrico peptide repeat superfamily

05901			428664	2986	5.30985644146936e-05	Excalibur	Excalibur calcium-binding domain. Extracellular Ca2+-dependent nuclease YokF from Bacillus subtilis and several other surface-exposed proteins from diverse bacteria are encoded in the genomes in two paralogous forms that differ by a ~45 amino acid fragment, which comprises a novel conserved domain. Sequence analysis of this domain revealed a conserved DxDxDGxxCE motif, which is strikingly similar to the Ca2+-binding loop of the calmodulin-like EF-hand domains, suggesting an evolutionary relationship between them. Functions of many of the other proteins in which the novel domain, named Excalibur (extracellular calcium-binding region), is found, as well as a structural model of its conserved motif are consistent with the notion that the Excalibur domain binds calcium. This domain is but one more example of the diversity of structural contexts surrounding the EF-hand-like calcium-binding loop in bacteria. This loop is thus more widespread than hitherto recognized and the evolution of EF-hand-like domains is probably more complex than previously appreciated.	36		Excalibur calcium-binding domain	Excalibur calcium-binding domain

A predicted RNA-binding domain found in insect Oskar and vertebrate TDRD5/TDRD7 proteins that nucleate or organize structurally related ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes, the polar granule and nuage, is poorly understood. The domain adopts the winged helix-turn- helix fold and bind RNA with a potential specificity for dsRNA.In eukaryotes this domain is often combined in the same polypeptide with protein-protein- or lipid- interaction domains that might play a role in anchoring these proteins to specific cytoskeletal structures. Thus, proteins with this domain might have a key role in the recognition and localization of dsRNA, including miRNAs, rasiRNAs and piRNAs hybridized to their targets. In other cases, this domain is fused to ubiquitin-binding, E3 ligase and ubiquitin-like domains indicating a previously under-appreciated role for ubiquitination in regulating the assembly and stability of nuage-like RNP complexes. Both bacteria and eukaryotes encode a conserved family of proteins that combines this predicted RNA-binding domain with a previously uncharacterized RNase domain belonging to the superfamily that includes the 5'->3' nucleases, PIN and NYN domains.	64	CL0123	OST-HTH/LOTUS domain	Helix-turn-helix clan

18073	Zn_Beta_Ribbon	Zinc beta-ribbon	436248	1957	3.480036522423154e-05	Rubredoxin_2	Rubredoxin metal binding domain. This is the C-terminal rubredoxin metal binding domain found in Interest in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) assembly protein B (LapB). Rubredoxin proteins form small non-heme iron binding sites that use four cysteine residues to coordinate a single metal ion in a tetrahedral environment. Rubredoxins are most commonly found in bacterial systems, but have also been found in eukaryotes. The key features of these rubredoxin-like domains are the extended loops or 'knuckles' and the tetracysteine mode of iron binding. Structural analysis of LapB from Escherichia coli show that the rubredoxin metal binding domain is intimately bound to the TPR motifs and that this association to the TPR motifs is essential to LPS regulation and growth in vivo. Other family members include RadA proteins which play a role in DNA damage repair. In E. coli, a protein known as RadA (or Sms) participates in the recombinational repair of radiation-damaged DNA in a process that uses an undamaged DNA strand in one DNA duplex to fill a DNA strand gap in a homologous sister DNA duplex. RadA carries a zinc finger at the N-terminal domain.	28	CL0167	Rubredoxin metal binding domain	Zinc beta-ribbon

The C-terminal domain featured in this family is organized into a sandwich of two anti-parallel beta-sheets, and has a relatively hydrophobic surface as compared to the N-terminal domain. Its precise function is unknown; it may mediate interactions with other cell wall-synthesising enzymes, thus allowing the protein to be recruited to areas of active cell wall synthesis. It may also function as a linker domain that positions the active site in the catalytic domain closer to the peptidoglycan layer, to allow it to interact with cell wall peptides.	91		Penicillin-binding protein 5, C-terminal domain	Penicillin-binding protein 5

The MOSC (MOCO sulfurase C-terminal) domain is a superfamily of beta-strand-rich domains identified in the molybdenum cofactor sulfurase and several other proteins from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. These MOSC domains contain an absolutely conserved cysteine and occur either as stand-alone forms or fused to other domains such as NifS-like catalytic domain in Molybdenum cofactor sulfurase. The MOSC domain is predicted to be a sulfur-carrier domain that receives sulfur abstracted by the pyridoxal phosphate-dependent NifS-like enzymes, on its conserved cysteine, and delivers it for the formation of diverse sulfur-metal clusters.	116		MOSC domain	MOSC domain

00188	CAP	Cysteine-rich secretory proteins	395136	1263	2.2459305711908245e-05	CAP	Cysteine-rich secretory protein family. This is a large family of cysteine-rich secretory proteins, antigen 5, and pathogenesis-related 1 proteins (CAP) that are found in a wide range of organisms, including prokaryotes and non-vertebrate eukaryotes, The nine subfamilies of the mammalian CAP 'super'family include: the human glioma pathogenesis-related 1 (GLIPR1), Golgi associated pathogenesis related-1 (GAPR1) proteins, peptidase inhibitor 15 (PI15), peptidase inhibitor 16 (PI16), cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISPs), CRISP LCCL domain containing 1 (CRISPLD1), CRISP LCCL domain containing 2 (CRISPLD2), mannose receptor like and the R3H domain containing like proteins. Members are most often secreted and have an extracellular endocrine or paracrine function and are involved in processes including the regulation of extracellular matrix and branching morphogenesis, potentially as either proteases or protease inhibitors; in ion channel regulation in fertility; as tumor suppressor or pro-oncogenic genes in tissues including the prostate; and in cell-cell adhesion during fertilisation. The overall protein structural conservation within the CAP 'super'family results in fundamentally similar functions for the CAP domain in all members, yet the diversity outside of this core region dramatically alters the target specificity and, thus, the biological consequences. The Ca++-chelating function would fit with the various signalling processes (e.g. the CRISP proteins) that members of this family are involved in, and also the sequence and structural evidence of a conserved pocket containing two histidines and a glutamate. It also may explain how the cysteine-rich venom protein helothermine blocks the Ca++ transporting ryanodine receptors.	117	CL0659	Cysteine-rich secretory protein family	Cysteine-rich secretory proteins

07484			429485	1219	2.1676875425824348e-05	Collar	Phage Tail Collar Domain. This region is occasionally found in conjunction with pfam03335. Most of the family appear to be phage tail proteins; however some appear to be involved in other processes. For instance a member from Rhizobium leguminosarum may be involved in plant-microbe interactions. A related protein MrpB is involved in the pathogenicity of Microcystis aeruginosa. The finding of this family in a structural component of the phage tail fibre baseplate suggests that its function is structural rather than enzymatic. Structural studies show this region consists of a helix and a loop and three beta-strands. This alignment does not catch the third strand as it is separated from the rest of the structure by around 100 residues. This strand is conserved in homologs but the intervening sequence is not. Much of the function of phage T4 appears to reside in this intervening region. In the tertiary structure of the phage baseplate this domain forms part of the 'collar'. The domain may bind SO4, however the residues accredited with this vary between the PDB file and the Swiss-Prot entry. The long unconserved region maybe due to domain swapping in and out of a loop or reflective of rapid evolution.	57		Phage Tail Collar Domain	Phage Tail Collar Domain

The PRD domain (for PTS Regulation Domain), is the phosphorylatable regulatory domain found in bacterial transcriptional antiterminator such as BglG, SacY and LicT, as well as in activators such as MtlR and LevR. The PRD is phosphorylated on one or two conserved histidine residues. PRD-containing proteins are involved in the regulation of catabolic operons in Gram+ and Gram- bacteria and are often characterized by a short N-terminal effector domain that binds to either RNA (CAT-RBD for antiterminators pfam03123) or DNA (for activators), and a duplicated PRD module which is phosphorylated by the sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) in response to the availability of carbon source. The phosphorylations modify the conformation and stability of the dimeric proteins and thereby the RNA- or DNA-binding activity of the effector domain.

02831			397116	1039	1.847602425548113e-05	gpW	gpW. gpW is a 68 residue protein known to be present in phage particles. Extracts of phage-infected cells lacking gpW contain DNA-filled heads, and active tails, but no infectious virions. gpW is required for the addition of gpFII to the head, which is, in turn, required for the attachment of tails. Since gpFII and tails are known to be attached at the connector, gpW is also likely to assemble at this site. The addition of gpW to filled heads increases the DNase resistance of the packaged DNA, suggesting that gpW either forms a plug at the connector to prevent ejection of the DNA, or binds directly to the DNA. The large number of positively charged residues in gpW (its calculated pI is 10.8) is consistent with a role in DNA interaction.	62		gpW	gpW

04358	HTH	Helix-turn-helix clan	427893	819	1.4563872825061639e-05	DsrC	DsrC like protein. Family member DsvC has been observed to co-purify with Desulfovibrio vulgaris dissimilatory sulfite reductase, and many members of this family are annotated as the third (gamma) subunit of dissimilatory sulphite reductase. However, this protein appears to be only loosely associated to the sulfite reductase, which suggests that DsrC may not be an integral part of the dissimilatory sulphite reductase. Members of this family are found in organisms such as E. coli and H. influenzae which do not contain dissimilatory sulphite reductases but can synthesize assimilatory sirohaem sulphite and nitrite reductases. It is speculated that DsrC may be involved in the assembly, folding or stabilisation of sirohaem proteins. The strictly conserved cysteine in the C-terminus suggests that DsrC may have a catalytic function in the metabolism of sulphur compounds.	107	CL0123	DsrC like protein	Helix-turn-helix clan

This family is found in Bacteria and Streptophyta includes members such as NdhS (NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase subunit S). NdhS, also known as CRR31 (chlororespiratory reduction 31), is a subunit of the chloroplast NADH dehydrogenase-like (NDH) complex. It is also a subunit of the cyanobacterial NDH-1 complex. NAD(P)H-oxidizing subunits have not been found in chloroplasts or cyanobacteria, where ferredoxin is probably the electron donor. NdhS contributes to the formation of a ferredoxin binding site of NDH and is necessary for high affinity binding of ferredoxin. The cyanobacterial NDH-1 complex, also known as NADPH:plastoquinone oxidoreductase or type I NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, is involved in plastoquinone reduction and cyclic electron transfer (CET) around photosystem I. The chloroplast NDH is more similar to cyanobacterial NDH-1, which is believed to be the origin of chloroplast NDH, than to mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase present in the same species. The NDH complexes of chloroplasts, however, contain many subunits that are absent from cyanobacterial NDH-1 complexes.	52	CL0010	NAD(P)H dehydrogenase subunit S	Src homology-3 domain

The release factor eRF1 terminates protein biosynthesis by recognising stop codons at the A site of the ribosome and stimulating peptidyl-tRNA bond hydrolysis at the peptidyl transferase centre. The crystal structure of human eRF1 is known. The overall shape and dimensions of eRF1 resemble a tRNA molecule with domains 1, 2, and 3 of eRF1 corresponding to the anticodon loop, aminoacyl acceptor stem, and T stem of a tRNA molecule, respectively. The position of the essential GGQ motif at an exposed tip of domain 2 suggests that the Gln residue coordinates a water molecule to mediate the hydrolytic activity at the peptidyl transferase centre. A conserved groove on domain 1, 80 A from the GGQ motif, is proposed to form the codon recognition site. This family also includes other proteins for which the precise molecular function is unknown.

02661			426907	684	1.2163234447304229e-05	Fic	Fic/DOC family. This family consists of the Fic (filamentation induced by cAMP) protein and doc (death on curing). The Fic protein is involved in cell division and is suggested to be involved in the synthesis of PAB or folate, indicating that the Fic protein and cAMP are involved in a regulatory mechanism of cell division via folate metabolism. This family contains a central conserved motif HPFXXGNG in most members. The exact molecular function of these proteins is uncertain. P1 lysogens of Escherichia coli carry the prophage as a stable low copy number plasmid. The frequency with which viable cells cured of prophage are produced is about 10(-5) per cell per generation. A significant part of this remarkable stability can be attributed to a plasmid-encoded mechanism that causes death of cells that have lost P1. In other words, the lysogenic cells appear to be addicted to the presence of the prophage. The plasmid withdrawal response depends on a gene named doc (death on curing) that is represented by this family. Doc induces a reversible growth arrest of E. coli cells by targetting the protein synthesis machinery. Doc hosts the C-terminal domain of its antitoxin partner Phd (prevents host death) through fold complementation, a domain that is intrinsically disordered in solution but that folds into an alpha-helix on binding to Doc.This domain forms complexes with Phd antitoxins containing pfam02604.	94		Fic/DOC family	Fic/DOC family

Gar1 is a small nucleolar RNP that is required for pre-mRNA processing and pseudouridylation. It is co-immunoprecipitated with the H/ACA families of snoRNAs. This family represents the conserved central region of Gar1. This region is necessary and sufficient for normal cell growth, and specifically binds two snoRNAs snR10 and snR30. This region is also necessary for nucleolar targeting, and it is thought that the protein is co-transported to the nucleolus as part of a nucleoprotein complex. In humans, Gar1 is also component of telomerase in vivo. Naf1 is an essential protein that plays a role in ribosome biogenesis, modification of spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs and telomere synthesis, and is homologous to Gar1.	89	CL0575	Gar1/Naf1 RNA binding region	Translation proteins of Elongation Factors superfamily

07012			429248	673	1.1967626875783251e-05	Curlin_rpt	Curlin associated repeat. This family consists of several bacterial repeats of around 30 residues in length. These repeats are often found in multiple copies in the curlin proteins CsgA and CsgB. Curli fibers are thin aggregative surface fibers, connected with adhesion, which bind laminin, fibronectin, plasminogen, human contact phase proteins, and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. Curli fibers are coded for by the csg gene cluster, which is comprised of two divergently transcribed operons. One operon encodes the csgB, csgA, and csgC genes, while the other encodes csgD, csgE, csgF, and csgG. The assembly of the fibers is unique and involves extracellular self-assembly of the curlin subunit (CsgA), dependent on a specific nucleator protein (CsgB). CsgD is a transcriptional activator essential for expression of the two curli fibre operons, and CsgG is an outer membrane lipoprotein involved in extracellular stabilisation of CsgA and CsgB.	34		Curlin associated repeat	Curlin associated repeat

This domain is deemed an additional C-terminal region, much like the SPC2-thiolase present in mammals which has an additional C-terminal domain termed the sterol carrier protein-2 (SPC2). However, the additional C-terminal domain in TLP1 folds differently to the traditional SCP2-fold observed in mammalian SPC2-thiolase. The topology of the C-terminal domain of TLP1 is reminiscent of single strand nucleic acid binding proteins.	83	CL0021	Thiolase-like protein type 1 additional C-terminal domain	OB fold

It has been shown to be vital for mycobacterial survival within host macrophages. Crystal structure revealed a Rossmann-like fold alpha/beta two-layer sandwich forming a highly hydrophobic interface cavity and with high structural homology to the SCP family. Hence, it has been suggested that this domain may be involved in the interaction of apolar ligands through its hydrophobic cavity. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the hydrophobic cavity of MSMEG_5817 protein demonstrated that the conserved Val82 residue plays an important role in ligand binding.	93	CL0311	Bacterial SCP ortholog	SCP-2 sterol transfer superfamily

04117			427722	629	1.1185196589699356e-05	Mpv17_PMP22	Mpv17 / PMP22 family. The 22-kDa peroxisomal membrane protein (PMP22) is a major component of peroxisomal membranes. PMP22 seems to be involved in pore forming activity and may contribute to the unspecific permeability of the organelle membrane. PMP22 is synthesized on free cytosolic ribosomes and then directed to the peroxisome membrane by specific targeting information. Mpv17 is a closely related peroxisomal protein. In mouse, the Mpv17 protein is involved in the development of early-onset glomerulosclerosis. More recently a homolog of Mpv17 in S. cerevisiae has been been found to be an integral membrane protein of the inner mitochondrial membrane where it has been proposed to have a role in ethanol metabolism and tolerance during heat-shock. Defects in MPV17 is associated with mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (MDDS) and Navajo neurohepatopathy (NNH). MDDS is a clinically heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by a reduction in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number. Primary mtDNA depletion is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait and may affect single organs, typically muscle or liver, or multiple tissues. Individuals with the hepatocerebral form of mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome have early progressive liver failure and neurologic abnormalities, hypoglycemia, and increased lactate in body fluids. NNH is an autosomal recessive disease that is prevalent among Navajo children in the South Western states of America. The major clinical features are hepatopathy, peripheral neuropathy, corneal anesthesia and scarring, acral mutilation, cerebral leukoencephalopathy, failure to thrive, and recurrent metabolic acidosis with intercurrent infections. Infantile, childhood, and classic forms of NNH have been described. Mitochondrial DNA depletion was detected in the livers of patients, suggesting a primary defect in mtDNA maintenance.	62		Mpv17 / PMP22 family	Mpv17 / PMP22 family

This is the neddylation site of cullin proteins which are a family of structurally related proteins containing an evolutionarily conserved cullin domain. With the exception of APC2, each member of the cullin family is modified by Nedd8 and several cullins function in Ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, a process in which the 26S proteasome recognizes and subsequently degrades a target protein tagged with K48-linked poly-ubiquitin chains. Cullins are molecular scaffolds responsible for assembling the ROC1/Rbx1 RING-based E3 ubiquitin ligases, of which several play a direct role in tumorigenesis. Nedd8/Rub1 is a small ubiquitin-like protein, which was originally found to be conjugated to Cdc53, a cullin component of the SCF (Skp1-Cdc53/CUL1-F-box protein) E3 Ub ligase complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Nedd8 modification has now emerged as a regulatory pathway of fundamental importance for cell cycle control and for embryogenesis in metazoans. The only identified Nedd8 substrates are cullins.

PNKP (polynucleotide 5'-kinase/3'-phosphatase) is the end-healing and end-sealing component of an RNA-repair system present in diverse bacteria from ten different phyla. RNA breakage by site-specific 'ribotoxins' is an ancient mechanism by which microbes respond to cellular stress and distinguish self from non-self. Ribotoxins are trans-esterifying endonucleases that generate 5'-OH and 2',3' cyclic phosphate termini. Repair of this type of RNA damage is feasible via sequential enzymatic end-healing and end-sealing steps. The exact function of this C-terminal region is unclear; however, the conformation of the bundles changes on transfer of a PO4 from ATP to AMP.	60		PNKP adenylyltransferase domain, C-terminal region	PNKP adenylyltransferase domain

11910			432182	530	9.424728446010583e-06	NdhO	Cyanobacterial and plant NDH-1 subunit O. The proton-pumping NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase catalyzes the electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone linked with proton translocation across the membrane. It is the largest, most complex and least understood of the respiratory chain enzymes and is referred to as Complex I. The subunit composition of the enzyme varies between groups of organisms. Complex I originating from mammalian mitochondria contains 45 different proteins, whereas in bacteria, the corresponding complex NDH-1 consists of 14 different polypeptides. homologs of these 14 proteins are found among subunits of the mitochondrial complex I, and therefore bacterial NDH-1 might be considered a model proton-pumping NADH dehydrogenase with a minimal set of subunits. Escherichia coli NDH-1 readily disintegrates into 3 subcomplexes: a water-soluble NADH dehydrogenase fragment (NuoE, -F, and -G),the connecting fragment (NuoB, -C, -D, and -I), and the membrane fragment (NuoA, -H, -J, -K, -L, -M, -N). In cyanobacteria and their descendants, the chloroplasts of green plants, the subunit composition of NDH-1 remains obscure. The genes for eleven subunits NdhA-NdhK, homologous to the NuoA-NuoD and NuoH-NuoN of the E. coli complex, have been found in the genome of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 which has a family of 6 ndhD genes and a family of 3 ndhF genes. Two reported multisubunit complexes, NDH-1L and NDH-1M, represent distinct NDH-1 complexes in the thylakoid membrane of Synechocystis 6803 -cyanobacterium. NDH-1L was shown to be essential for photoheterotrophic cell growth, whereas expression of NDH-1M was a prerequisite for CO2 uptake and played an important role in growth of cells at low CO2. Here we report the subunit composition of these two complexes. Fifteen proteins were discovered in NDH-1L including NdhL, a new component of the membrane fragment, and Ssl1690 (designated as NdhO), a novel peripheral subunit. The three nuclear-encoded subunits NdhM,NdhN and NdhO are vital for the functional integrity of the plastidial complex.	65		Cyanobacterial and plant NDH-1 subunit O	Cyanobacterial and plant NDH-1 subunit O

Clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) loci play a pivotal role in the prokaryotic host defense system against invading genetic materials. The CRISPR loci are transcribed to produce CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs), which form interference complexes with CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins to target the invading nucleic acid for degradation. The interference complex of the type III-A CRISPR-Cas system is composed of five Cas proteins (Csm1-Csm5) and a crRNA, and targets invading DNA. This entry represents the C-terminal domain found in Csm4. Csm4 structurally resembles Cmr3, a component of the type III-B CRISPR-Cas interference complex. Studies indicate that Csm3-Csm4 complex binds single-stranded RNA in a non-sequence-specific manner. Structural analysis show, Csm3 and Csm4 have one and two ferredoxin-like folds (also known as an RRM-like fold), respectively. The long beta-hairpin inserted into the C-terminal ferredoxin-like fold of Csm4, is well-conserved in the Cmr3 structure. The corresponding beta-hairpin of Cmr3 binds the D1 domain of Cmr2, as observed in the Cmr2-Cmr3 complex structure. Furthermore, it is suggested that the hairpin of Csm4 is responsible for the interaction with Csm1 (ortholog of Cmr2).	91	CL0362	CRISPR Csm4 C-terminal domain	CRISPR-associated (Cas) Repair Associated Mysterious Proteins

18593			436605	464	8.25108301688474e-06	CdiI_2	CdiI immunity protein. Contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI) is an important mechanism of inter-bacterial competition found in many Gram-negative pathogens. CDI+ cells express cell-surface CdiA proteins that bind neighboring bacteria and deliver C-terminal toxin domains (CdiA-CT) to inhibit target-cell growth. CDI+ bacteria also produce CdiI immunity proteins, which specifically neutralize cognate CdiA-CT toxins to prevent self-inhibition. Structure analysis of CdiI immunity protein from Yersinia kristensenii shows that it is composed of eight alpha-helices packed together to form a nearly spherical structure with weak structural homology to a putative TetR family transcriptional repressor. The CdiI protein fits into the curved cavity of the CdiA-CTYkris toxin domain where it most likely neutralizes toxin activity by blocking access to RNA substrates. This domain is mostly found in gammaproteobacteria.	91		CdiI immunity protein	CdiI immunity protein

09472			430631	434	7.717607821827537e-06	MtrF	Tetrahydromethanopterin S-methyltransferase, F subunit (MtrF). Many archaea have evolved energy-yielding pathways marked by one-carbon biochemistry featuring novel cofactors and enzymes. This domain is mostly found in MtrF, where it covers the entire length of the protein. This polypeptide is one of eight subunits of the N5-methyltetrahydromethanopterin: coenzyme M methyltransferase complex found in methanogenic archaea. This is a membrane-associated enzyme complex that uses methyl-transfer reactions to drive a sodium-ion pump. MtrF itself is involved in the transfer of the methyl group from N5-methyltetrahydromethanopterin to coenzyme M. Subsequently, methane is produced by two-electron reduction of the methyl moiety in methyl-coenzyme M by another enzyme, methyl-coenzyme M reductase. In some organisms this domain is found at the C terminal region of what appears to be a fusion of the MtrA and MtrF proteins. The function of these proteins is unknown, though it is likely that they are involved in C1 metabolism.	62		Tetrahydromethanopterin S-methyltransferase, F subunit (MtrF)	Tetrahydromethanopterin S-methyltransferase

Holins are encoded within the genomes of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as in those of the bacteriophage of these organisms. The primary function of holins appears to be transport of murein hydrolases across the cytoplasmic membrane to the cell wall where these enzymes hydrolyze the cell wall polymer as a prelude to cell lysis. When chromosomally encoded the enzymes are therefore autolysins. Holins may also facilitate leakage of electrolytes and nutrients from the cell cytoplasm, thereby promoting cell death.

TetR family regulators are involved in the transcriptional control of multidrug efflux pumps, pathways for the biosynthesis of antibiotics, response to osmotic stress and toxic chemicals, control of catabolic pathways, differentiation processes, and pathogenicity. The TetR proteins identified in overm ultiple genera of bacteria and archaea share a common helix-turn-helix (HTH) structure in their DNA-binding domain. However, TetR proteins can work in different ways: they can bind a target operator directly to exert their effect (e.g. TetR binds Tet(A) gene to repress it in the absence of tetracycline), or they can be involved in complex regulatory cascades in which the TetR protein can either be modulated by another regulator or TetR can trigger the cellular response. TetR regulates the expression of the membrane-associated tetracycline resistance protein, TetA, which exports the tetracycline antibiotic out of the cell before it can attach to the ribosomes and inhibit protein synthesis. TetR blocks transcription from the genes encoding both TetA and TetR in the absence of antibiotic. The C-terminal domain is multi-helical and is interlocked in the homodimer with the helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding domain. This entry represents the C-terminal domain present in family members such as HTH-type transcriptional repressor KstR2 as well as fatty acid metabolism regulator proteins.

It has two transmembrane segments with both the N- and C-termini on the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane in E. coli. Holins are a diverse family of proteins that cause bacterial membrane lysis during late-protein synthesis.

08951			430340	338	6.010487197644487e-06	EntA_Immun	Enterocin A Immunity. Gram-positive lactobacilli produce bacteriocins to kill closely-related competitor species. To protect themselves from the bacteriocidal activity of this molecule they co-express an immunity protein (for discussion of this operon see Bacteriocin_IIc pfam10439). The immunity protein structure is a soluble, cytoplasmic, antiparallel four alpha-helical globular bundle with a fifth, more flexible and more divergent C-terminal helical hair-pin. The C-terminal hair-pin recognizes the C-terminus of the producer bacteriocin and this interaction is sufficient to dis-orient the bacteriocin within the membrane and close up the permeabilising pore that on its own the bacteriocin creates. These immunity proteins interact in the same way with other bacteriocins, family Bacteriocin_II, pfam01721. Since many enterococci can produce more than one bacteriocin it seems likely that the whole operon can be carried on transferable plasmids.	68		Enterocin A Immunity	Enterocin A Immunity

06747	CHCH	Coiled-coil helix coiled-coil helix superfamily	429096	327	5.814879626123512e-06	CHCH	CHCH domain. we have identified a conserved motif in the LOC118487 protein that we have called the CHCH motif. Alignment of this protein with related members showed the presence of three subgroups of proteins, which are called the S (Small), N (N-terminal extended) and C (C-terminal extended) subgroups. All three sub-groups of proteins have in common that they contain a predicted conserved [coiled coil 1]-[helix 1]-[coiled coil 2]-[helix 2] domain (CHCH domain). Within each helix of the CHCH domain, there are two cysteines present in a C-X9-C motif. The N-group contains an additional double helix domain, and each helix contains the C-X9-C motif. This family contains a number of characterized proteins: Cox19 protein - a nuclear gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, codes for an 11-kDa protein (Cox19p) required for expression of cytochrome oxidase. Because cox19 mutants are able to synthesize the mitochondrial and nuclear gene products of cytochrome oxidase, Cox19p probably functions post-translationally during assembly of the enzyme. Cox19p is present in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, where it exists as a soluble intermembrane protein. This dual location is similar to what was previously reported for Cox17p, a low molecular weight copper protein thought to be required for maturation of the CuA centre of subunit 2 of cytochrome oxidase. Cox19p have four conserved potential metal ligands, these are three cysteines and one histidine. Mrp10 - belongs to the class of yeast mitochondrial ribosomal proteins that are essential for translation. Eukaryotic NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 19 kDa (NDUFA8) subunit. The CHCH domain was previously called DUF657.	35	CL0351	CHCH domain	Coiled-coil helix coiled-coil helix superfamily

03123			427152	312	5.548142028594911e-06	CAT_RBD	CAT RNA binding domain. This RNA binding domain is found at the amino terminus of transcriptional antitermination proteins such as BglG, SacY and LicT. These proteins control the expression of sugar metabolising operons in Gram+ and Gram- bacteria. This domain has been called the CAT (Co-AntiTerminator) domain. It binds as a dimer to short Ribonucleotidic Anti-Terminator (RAT) hairpin, each monomer interacting symmetrically with both strands of the RAT hairpin. In the full-length protein, CAT is followed by two phosphorylatable PTS regulation domains (pfam00874) that modulate the RNA binding activity of CAT. Upon activation, the dimeric proteins bind to RAT targets in the nascent mRNA, thereby preventing abortive dissociation of the RNA polymerase from the DNA template.	55		CAT RNA binding domain	CAT RNA binding domain

CysG, S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent bis-methyltransferase, dehydrogenase and ferrochelatase, synthesizes sirohaem from uroporphyrinogen III via reactions which encompass two branchpoint intermediates in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis, diverting flux first from protoporphyrin IX biosynthesis and then from cobalamin (vitamin B12) biosynthesis. CysG is a dimer of two structurally similar protomers held together asymmetrically through a number of salt-bridges across complementary residues in the CysG_dimerizer region to produce a series of active sites, accounting for CysG's multifunctionality, catalyzing four diverse reactions: two SAM-dependent methylations, NAD+-dependent tetrapyrrole dehydrogenation and metal chelation.

CENP-C is the inner-kinetochore centromere (CEN) binding protein. In the budding-yeast, Mif2, the yeast homolog, binds in the CDEIII region of the centromere, and has been shown to recruit a substantial subset of all inner and outer kinetochore proteins. Mif2 adopts a cupin fold and is extremely similar both in polypeptide chain conformation and in dimer geometry to the dimerization domain of a bacterial transcription factor. The Mif2 dimer appears to be part of an enhanceosome-like structure that nucleates kinetochore assembly in budding yeast.

It induces necrosis of infected cells to evade immune responses. Mtb utilizes the protein CpnT to kill human macrophages by secreting its C-terminal domain (CTD), named tuberculosis necrotizing toxin (TNT) that induces necrosis. It acts as a NAD+ glycohydrolase which hydrolyzes the essential cellular coenzyme NAD+ in the cytosol of infected macrophages resulting in necrotic cell death. CpnT transports its toxic CTD from the cell surface of M. tuberculosis by proteolytic cleavage, where the toxin is cleaved to induce host cell death. Structural analysis determined that the TNT core contains only six beta-strands as opposed to seven found in all known NAD+-utilizing toxins, and is significantly smaller, with only two short alpha-helices and two 3/10 helices. Furthermore, the putative NAD+ binding pocket identified Q822, Y765 and R757 as residues possibly involved in NAD+-binding and hydrolysis based on similar positions of catalytic amino acids of ADP-ribosylating toxins. While glutamine 822 residue was detected to be highly conserved among TNT homologs.	84	CL0084	Tuberculosis necrotizing toxin	ADP-ribosylation Superfamily

Phage_holin_3_3 is a family of small hydrophobic holin proteins with one or more transmembrane domains. Holins are encoded within the genomes of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as those of the bacteriophages of these organisms. Their primary function appears to be transport of murein hydrolases across the cytoplasmic membrane to the cell wall where these enzymes hydrolyze the cell wall polymer as a prelude to cell lysis. When chromosomally encoded, these enzymes are therefore autolysins. Holins may also facilitate leakage of electrolytes and nutrients from the cell cytoplasm, thereby promoting cell death. Some may catalyze export of nucleases. LydA and lydB are encoded on the dar operon. The phenotype of a rapid lysis in the absence of active LydB suggests that this protein might be an antagonist of the holin LydA.	78	CL0564	LydA holin phage, holin superfamily III	Holin superfamily III

The members of this family are similar to a region of the protein product of the bacterial tadE locus. In various bacterial species, the tad locus is closely linked to flp-like genes, which encode proteins required for the production of pili involved in adherence to surfaces. It is thought that the tad loci encode proteins that act to assemble or export an Flp pilus in various bacteria. All tad loci but TadA have putative transmembrane regions, and in fact the region in question is this family has a high proportion of hydrophobic amino acid residues.	43	CL0496	TadE-like protein	Flp pilus-biogenesis Tad-like superfamily

The crystal structure of Caenorhabditis elegans F53F4.3 protein CAP-Gly domain was recently solved. The domain contains three beta-strands.

12661	EGF	EGF superfamily	432703	286	5.0857968595453344e-06	hEGF	Human growth factor-like EGF. hEGF, or human growth factor-like EGF, domains have six conserved residues disulfide-bonded into the characteristic 'ababcc' pattern. They are involved in growth and proliferation of cells, in proteins of the Notch/Delta pathway, neurogulin and selectins. hEGFs are also found in mosaic proteins with four-disulfide laminin EGFs such as aggrecan and perlecan. The core fold of the EGF domain consists of two small beta-hairpins packed against each other. Two major structural variants have been identified based on the structural context of the C-terminal Cys residue of disulfide 'c' in the C-terminal hairpin: hEGFs and cEGFs. In hEGFs the C-terminal thiol resides in the beta-turn, resulting in shorter loop-lengths between the Cys residues of disulfide 'c', typically C[8-9]XC. These shorter loop-lengths are also typical of the four-disulfide EGF domains, laminin ad integrin. Tandem hEGF domains have six linking residues between terminal cysteines of adjacent domains. hEGF domains may or may not bind calcium in the linker region. hEGF domains with the consensus motif CXD4X[F,Y]XCXC are hydroxylated exclusively in the Asp residue.	22	CL0001	Human growth factor-like EGF	EGF superfamily

This family consists of the C-terminal region of several eukaryotic and archaeal RuvB-like 1 (Pontin or TIP49a) and RuvB-like 2 (Reptin or TIP49b) proteins. The N-terminal domain contains the pfam00004 domain. In zebrafish, the liebeskummer (lik) mutation, causes development of hyperplastic embryonic hearts. lik encodes Reptin, a component of a DNA-stimulated ATPase complex. Beta-catenin and Pontin, a DNA-stimulated ATPase that is often part of complexes with Reptin, are in the same genetic pathways. The Reptin/Pontin ratio serves to regulate heart growth during development, at least in part via the beta-catenin pathway. TBP-interacting protein 49 (TIP49) was originally identified as a TBP-binding protein, and two related proteins are encoded by individual genes, tip49a and b. Although the function of this gene family has not been elucidated, they are supposed to play a critical role in nuclear events because they interact with various kinds of nuclear factors and have DNA helicase activities.TIP49a has been suggested to act as an autoantigen in some patients with autoimmune diseases.	66	CL0671	TIP49 AAA-lid domain	AAA+ ATPase lid domain superfamily
05105			428306	280	4.979101820533894e-06	Phage_holin_4_1	Bacteriophage holin family. Phage holins and lytic enzymes are both necessary for bacterial lysis and virus dissemination. This family also includes TcdE/UtxA involved in toxin secretion in Clostridium difficile. The 1.E.10 family is represented by Bacillus subtilis phi29 holin; 1.E.16 represents the Cph1 holin; and the 1.E.19 family is represented by the Clostridium difficile TcdE holin. Toxigenic strains of C. difficile produce two large toxins (TcdA and TcdB) encoded within a pathogenicity locus. tcdE, encoded between tcdA and tcdB, encodes a 166 aa protein which causes death to E. coli when expressed, and the structure of TcdE resembles holins. TcdE acts on the bacterial membrane. Since TcdA and TcdB lack signal peptides, they may be released via TcdE either prior to or subsequent to cell lysis.	109		Bacteriophage holin family	Bacteriophage holin family

01751	Toprim-like	Toprim domain	396354	258	4.587886677491945e-06	Toprim	Toprim domain. This is a conserved region from DNA primase. This corresponds to the Toprim domain common to DnaG primases, topoisomerases, OLD family nucleases and RecR proteins. Both DnaG motifs IV and V are present in the alignment, the DxD (V) motif may be involved in Mg2+ binding and mutations to the conserved glutamate (IV) completely abolish DnaG type primase activity. DNA primase EC:2.7.7.6 is a nucleotidyltransferase it synthesizes the oligoribonucleotide primers required for DNA replication on the lagging strand of the replication fork; it can also prime the leading stand and has been implicated in cell division. This family also includes the atypical archaeal A subunit from type II DNA topoisomerases. Type II DNA topoisomerases catalyze the relaxation of DNA supercoiling by causing transient double strand breaks.	93	CL0413	Toprim domain	Toprim domain
12554			432631	257	4.570104170990039e-06	MOZART1	Mitotic-spindle organizing gamma-tubulin ring associated. The name MOZART is derived from letters of 'mitotic-spindle organizing proteins associated with a ring of gamma-tubulin'. This family operates as part of the gamma-tubulin ring complex, gamma-TuRC, one of the complexes necessary for chromosome segregation. This complex is located at centrosomes and mediates the formation of bipolar spindles in mitosis; it consists of six subunits. However, unlike the other four known subunits, this family does not carry the conserved 'Spc97-Spc98' GCP domain, so the TUBCGP nomenclature cannot be used for it. MOZART1 is required for gamma-TuRC recruitment to centrosomes.	43		Mitotic-spindle organizing gamma-tubulin ring associated	Mitotic-spindle organizing gamma-tubulin ring associated

13018			432938	255	4.534539157986225e-06	ESPR	Extended Signal Peptide of Type V secretion system. This conserved domain is called ESPR for Extended Signal Peptide Region. It is present at the N-terminus of the signal peptides of proteins belonging to the Type V secretion systems, including the autotransporters (T5aSS), TpsA exoproteins of the two-partner system (T5bSS) and trimeric autotransporters (TAAs). So far, the ESPR is present only in Gram-negative bacterial proteins originating from the classes Beta- and Gamma-proteobacteria. ESPR severely impairs inner membrane translocation, suggesting that it adopts a particular conformation or it interacts with a cytoplasmic or inner membrane co-factor, prior to exportation. Deletion of ESPR causes mis-folding of the TAAs passenger domain in the periplasm, substantially impairing its translocation across the outer membrane.	50		Extended Signal Peptide of Type V secretion system	Extended Signal Peptide of Type V secretion system

Ectocarpus has a large family of EsV-1-7 domain proteins with between one and 19 copies of the motif (C-X4-C-X16-C-X2-H-X12). In addition to brown algae, EsV-1-7 domain proteins have been found in eustigmatophytes, oomycetes, cryptophytes, two families of green algae (Coccomyxaceae and Selenastraceae) and also in viral genomes, such as Emiliania huxleyi virus PS401 and Pithovirus sibericum.

The N-terminus region of PS1 contains an esterase domain which transfers corynomycolic acid. The C-terminus region consists of 4 tandem LGFP repeats. It is hypothesized that the PS1 proteins in Corynebacterium, when associated with the cell wall, may be anchored via the LGFP tandem repeats that may be important for maintaining cell wall integrity [Adindla et al. Comparative and Functional Genomics 2004; 5:2-16]. Deletion of Corynebacterium glutamicum csp1 protein results in a 10-fold increase in the cell volume of the organism and infers the corresponding proteins involvement in the cell shape formation.

This chemotaxis protein stimulates methylation of MCP proteins. The chemotaxis machinery of Bacillus subtilis is similar to that of the well characterized system of Escherichia coli. However, B. subtilis contains several chemotaxis genes not found in the E. coli genome, such as CheC and CheD, indicating that the B. subtilis chemotactic system is more complex. CheD plays an important role in chemotactic sensory transduction for many organisms. CheD deamidates other B. subtilis chemoreceptors including McpB and McpC. Deamidation by CheD is required for B. subtilis chemoreceptors to effectively transduce signals to the CheA kinase. The structure of a complex between the signal-terminating phosphatase, CheC, and the receptor-modifying deamidase, CheD, reveals how CheC mimics receptor substrates to inhibit CheD and how CheD stimulates CheC phosphatase activity. CheD resembles other cysteine deamidases from bacterial pathogens that inactivate host Rho-GTPases. Phospho-CheY, the intracellular signal and CheC target, stabilizes the CheC-CheD complex and reduces availability of CheD. A model is proposed whereby CheC acts as a CheY-P-induced regulator of CheD; CheY-P would cause CheC to sequester CheD from the chemoreceptors, inducing adaptation of the chemotaxis system.	106	CL0663	CheD chemotactic sensory transduction	CNF1/YfiH-like putative cysteine hydrolases

During interaction with DNA, helix alpha2 is thought to insert into the major groove, while the wing contacts the adjacent minor groove or phosphodiester backbone. The C-terminal region of Xis is involved in interaction with phage-encoded integrase (Int), and a putative C-terminal alpha helix may fold upon interaction with Int and/or DNA.	72	CL0123	Excisionase-like protein	Helix-turn-helix clan

The EB1 proteins contain an N-terminal CH domain pfam00307. The human EB1 protein was originally discovered as a protein interacting with the C-terminus of the APC protein. This interaction is often disrupted in colon cancer, due to deletions affecting the APC C-terminus. Several EB1 orthologues are also included in this family. The interaction between EB1 and APC has been shown to have a potent synergistic effect on microtubule polymerization. Neither of EB1 or APC alone has this effect. It is thought that EB1 targets APC to the + ends of microtubules, where APC promotes microtubule polymerization. This process is regulated by APC phosphorylation by Cdc2, which disrupts APC-EB1 binding. Human EB1 protein can functionally substitute for the yeast EB1 homolog Mal3. In addition, Mal3 can substitute for human EB1 in promoting microtubule polymerization with APC.	41		EB1-like C-terminal motif	EB1-like C-terminal motif

TetR family regulators are involved in the transcriptional control of multidrug efflux pumps, pathways for the biosynthesis of antibiotics, response to osmotic stress and toxic chemicals, control of catabolic pathways, differentiation processes, and pathogenicity. The TetR proteins identified in overm ultiple genera of bacteria and archaea share a common helix-turn-helix (HTH) structure in their DNA-binding domain. However, TetR proteins can work in different ways: they can bind a target operator directly to exert their effect (e.g. TetR binds Tet(A) gene to repress it in the absence of tetracycline), or they can be involved in complex regulatory cascades in which the TetR protein can either be modulated by another regulator or TetR can trigger the cellular response. TetR regulates the expression of the membrane-associated tetracycline resistance protein, TetA, which exports the tetracycline antibiotic out of the cell before it can attach to the ribosomes and inhibit protein synthesis. TetR blocks transcription from the genes encoding both TetA and TetR in the absence of antibiotic. The C-terminal domain is multi-helical and is interlocked in the homodimer with the helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding domain. This entry represents the C-terminal domain present in CgmR (C. glutamicum multidrug-responsive transcriptional repressor), previously called CGL2612 protein. CgmR (CGL2612) from Corynebacterium glutamicum is a multidrug-resistance-related transcription factor belonging to the TetR family. It regulates expression of the immediately upstream gene cgmA (cgl2611) by binding to the operator cgmO in the cgmA promoter. The cgmA gene encodes a permease belonging to the major facilitator superfamily, a protein family composed of bacterial multidrug exporters, and the pair of CgmR and CgmA confers multidrug resistance on C. glutamicum.	97	CL0174	Tetracyclin repressor-like, C-terminal domain	TetR protein, C-terminal domain-like

TetR family regulators are involved in the transcriptional control of multidrug efflux pumps, pathways for the biosynthesis of antibiotics, response to osmotic stress and toxic chemicals, control of catabolic pathways, differentiation processes, and pathogenicity. The TetR proteins identified in overm ultiple genera of bacteria and archaea share a common helix-turn-helix (HTH) structure in their DNA-binding domain. However, TetR proteins can work in different ways: they can bind a target operator directly to exert their effect (e.g. TetR binds Tet(A) gene to repress it in the absence of tetracycline), or they can be involved in complex regulatory cascades in which the TetR protein can either be modulated by another regulator or TetR can trigger the cellular response. This entry represents the C-terminal domain found in a number of different TetR transcription regulator proteins found in Actinobacteria. TetR regulates the expression of the membrane-associated tetracycline resistance protein, TetA, which exports the tetracycline antibiotic out of the cell before it can attach to the ribosomes and inhibit protein synthesis. TetR blocks transcription from the genes encoding both TetA and TetR in the absence of antibiotic. The C-terminal domain is multi-helical and is interlocked in the homodimer with the helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding domain.	107	CL0174	Tetracyclin repressor-like, C-terminal domain	TetR protein, C-terminal domain-like

03047	GG-leader	Double-Glycine leader-peptide cleavage motif	335196	167	2.9696785858184298e-06	ComC	COMC family. This family consists exclusively of streptococcal competence stimulating peptide precursors, which are generally up to 50 amino acid residues long. In all the members of this family, the leader sequence is cleaved after two conserved glycine residues; thus the leader sequence is of the double- glycine type. Competence stimulating peptides (CSP) are small (less than 25 amino acid residues) cationic peptides. The N-terminal amino acid residue is negatively charged, either glutamate or aspartate. The C-terminal end is positively charged. The third residue is also positively charged: a highly conserved arginine. A few COMC proteins and their precursors (not included in this family) do not fully follow the above description. In particular: the leader sequence in the CSP precursor from Streptococcus sanguis NCTC 7863 is not of the double-glycine type; the CSP from Streptococcus gordonii NCTC 3165 does not have a negatively charged N-terminus residue and has a lysine instead of arginine at the third position. Functionally, CSP act as pheromones, stimulating competence for genetic transformation in streptococci. In streptococci, the (CSP mediated) competence response requires exponential cell growth at a critical density, a relatively simple requirement when compared to the stationary-phase requirement of Haemophilus, or the late-logarithmic- phase of Bacillus. All bacteria induced to competence by a particular CSP are said to belong to the same pherotype, because each CSP is recognized by a specific receptor (the signalling domain of a histidine kinase ComD). Pherotypes are not necessarily species-specific. In addition, an organism may change pherotype. There are two possible mechanisms for pherotype switching: horizontal gene transfer, and accumulation of point mutations. The biological significance of pherotypes and pherotype switching is not definitively determined. Pherotype switching occurs frequently enough in naturally competent streptococci to suggest that it may be an important contributor to genetic exchange between different bacterial species. The family Antibacterial16, streptolysins from group A streptococci, has been merged into this family.	31	CL0400	COMC family	Double-Glycine leader-peptide cleavage motif

Apc11 acts as an E3 enzyme and is responsible for recruiting E2s to the APC and for mediating the subsequent transfer of ubiquitin to APC substrates in vivo. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae this RING-H2 finger protein defines the minimal ubiquitin ligase activity of the APC, and the integrity of the RING-H2 finger is essential for budding yeast cell viability.	85	CL0229	Anaphase-promoting complex subunit 11 RING-H2 finger	Ring-finger/U-box superfamily

The oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane and consists of five multi-subunit enzyme complexes and two small electron carriers: coenzyme Q10 and cytochrome C. At least 70 structural proteins involved in the formation of the whole OXPHOS system are encoded by nuclear genes, whereas 13 structural proteins are encoded by the mitochondrial genome. Deficiency of NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase, the first enzyme complex of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, is one of the most frequent causes of human mitochondrial encephalomyopathies.	62	CL0351	NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase B18 subunit (NDUFB7)	Coiled-coil helix coiled-coil helix superfamily

The domain is widespread in bacteria and seen in the firmicutes, actinobacteria, certain proteobacteria, bacteroides and chlamydiae with an expansion in Clostridium. In contrast, it is limited in its distribution in eukaryotes suggesting that it was derived through lateral transfer from bacteria. In prokaryotes, this domain is widely fused to other domains such as FNIII (Fibronectin Type III), TIG, SLH (S-layer homology), discoidin, cell-wall-binding repeat domain and alpha-amylase-like glycohydrolases.

00379			425649	154	2.738506001293642e-06	Chitin_bind_4	Insect cuticle protein. Many insect cuticular proteins include a 35-36 amino acid motif known as the R&R consensus. The extensive conservation of this region led to the suggestion that it functions to bind chitin. Provocatively, it has no sequence similarity to the well-known cysteine-containing chitin-binding domain found in chitinases and some peritrophic membrane proteins. Chitin binding has been shown experimentally for this region. Thus arthropods have two distinct classes of chitin binding proteins, those with the chitin-binding domain found in lectins, chitinases and peritrophic membranes (cysCBD) and those with the cuticular protein chitin-binding domain (non-cysCBD).	52		Insect cuticle protein	Insect cuticle protein

13682			433401	142	2.5251159232707605e-06	CZB	Chemoreceptor zinc-binding domain. The chemoreceptor zinc-binding domain (CZB) is found in bacterial signal transduction proteins - most frequently receptors involved in chemotaxis and motility, but also in c-di-GMP signalling and nitrate/nitrite-sensing. Originally discovered in the cytoplasmic chemoreceptor TlpD from Helicobacter pylori, it is often found C-terminal to the MCPsignal domain in cytoplasmic chemoreceptor proteins. The CZB domain contains a core sequence motif, Hxx[WFYL]x21-28Cx[LFMVI]Gx[WFLVI]x18-27HxxxH. The highly-conserved H-C-H-H residues of this motif are believed to coordinate zinc; mutating the latter two histidines of the motif to alanines abolishes Zn binding. This domain binds zinc with high affinity, with a Kd in the femtomolar range. This domain has been shown in E. coli to be a zinc sensor that regulates the catalytic activity of pfam00990.	64		Chemoreceptor zinc-binding domain	Chemoreceptor zinc-binding domain

The HR1 repeat was first described as a three times repeated homology region of the N-terminal non-catalytic part of protein kinase PRK1(PKN). The first two of these repeats were later shown to bind the small G protein rho known to activate PKN in its GTP-bound form. Similar rho-binding domains also occur in a number of other protein kinases and in the rho-binding proteins rhophilin and rhotekin.

11969	HIT	HIT superfamily	432228	139	2.4717684037650398e-06	DcpS_C	Scavenger mRNA decapping enzyme C-term binding. This family consists of several scavenger mRNA decapping enzymes (DcpS) and is the C-terminal region. DcpS is a scavenger pyrophosphatase that hydrolyzes the residual cap structure following 3' to 5' decay of an mRNA. The association of DcpS with 3' to 5' exonuclease exosome components suggests that these two activities are linked and there is a coupled exonucleolytic decay-dependent decapping pathway. The C-terminal domain contains a histidine triad (HIT) sequence with three histidines separated by hydrophobic residues. The central histidine within the DcpS HIT motif is critical for decapping activity and defines the HIT motif as a new mRNA decapping domain, making DcpS the first member of the HIT family of proteins with a defined biological function.	114	CL0265	Scavenger mRNA decapping enzyme C-term binding	HIT superfamily

08711			430168	135	2.400638377757413e-06	Med26	TFIIS helical bundle-like domain. Mediator is a large complex of up to 33 proteins that is conserved from plants to fungi to humans - the number and representation of individual subunits varying with species {1-2]. It is arranged into four different sections, a core, a head, a tail and a kinase-activity part, and the number of subunits within each of these is what varies with species. Overall, Mediator regulates the transcriptional activity of RNA polymerase II but it would appear that each of the four different sections has a slightly different function. Mediator exists in two major forms in human cells: a smaller form that interacts strongly with pol II and activates transcription, and a large form that does not interact strongly with pol II and does not directly activate transcription. Notably, the 'small' and 'large' Mediator complexes differ in their subunit composition: the Med26 subunit preferentially associates with the small, active complex, whereas cdk8, cyclin C, Med12 and Med13 associate with the large Mediator complex. This family includesthe C terminal region of a number of eukaryotic hypothetical proteins which are homologous to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein IWS1.

TetR family regulators are involved in the transcriptional control of multidrug efflux pumps, pathways for the biosynthesis of antibiotics, response to osmotic stress and toxic chemicals, control of catabolic pathways, differentiation processes, and pathogenicity. The TetR proteins identified in overm ultiple genera of bacteria and archaea share a common helix-turn-helix (HTH) structure in their DNA-binding domain. However, TetR proteins can work in different ways: they can bind a target operator directly to exert their effect (e.g. TetR binds Tet(A) gene to repress it in the absence of tetracycline), or they can be involved in complex regulatory cascades in which the TetR protein can either be modulated by another regulator or TetR can trigger the cellular response. This entry represents the C-terminal domain found in a number of different TetR transcription regulator proteins including SlmA proteins found in E. coli. Unlike other TetR proteins, SlmA functions not as a transcription regulator but rather as an NO (nucleoid occlusion) factor. TetR regulates the expression of the membrane-associated tetracycline resistance protein, TetA, which exports the tetracycline antibiotic out of the cell before it can attach to the ribosomes and inhibit protein synthesis. TetR blocks transcription from the genes encoding both TetA and TetR in the absence of antibiotic. The C-terminal domain is multi-helical and is interlocked in the homodimer with the helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding domain.	108	CL0174	Tetracyclin repressor-like, C-terminal domain	TetR protein, C-terminal domain-like

T4 gene-59 helicase assembly protein binds to both T4 gene-41 helicase and T4 gene-32 single-stranded DNA binding protein, and to single and double-stranded DNA. The structure of T4 gene-59 helicase assembly protein reveals a novel alpha-helical bundle fold with two domains of similar size, this being the C-terminal domain that consists of seven alpha-helices with short intervening loops and turns. The surface of the domain contains large regions of exposed hydrophobic residues and clusters of acidic and basic residues. The hydrophobic region on the 'bottom' surface of the domain near the C-terminal helix binds the leading strand DNA, whilst the hydrophobic region on the 'top' surface of the domain lies between the two arms of the fork DNA, allowing for T4 gene 41 helicase binding and assembly into a hexameric complex around the lagging strand.	109		T4 gene Gp59 loader of gp41 DNA helicase C-term	T4 gene Gp59 loader of gp41 DNA helicase C-term

This Autotransporter-associated beta strand repeat model represents a core 32-residue region of a class of bacterial protein repeat found in one to 30 copies per protein. Most proteins with a copy of this repeat have domains associated with membrane autotransporters (pfam03797). The repeats occur with a periodicity of 60 to 100 residues. A pattern of sequence conservation is that every second residue is well-conserved across most of the domain. These repeats as likely to have a beta-helical structure. This repeat plays a role in the efficient transport of autotransporter virulence factors to the bacterial surface during growth and infection. The repeat is always associated with the passenger domain of the autotransporter. For these reasons it has been coined the Passenger-associated Transport Repeat (PATR). The mechanism by which the PATR motif promotes transport is uncertain but it is likely that the conserved glycines (see HMM Logo) are required for flexibility of folding and that this folding drives secretion. Autotransporters that contain PATR(s) associate with distinct virulence traits such as subtilisin (S8) type protease domains and polymorphic outer-membrane protein repeats, whilst SPATE (S6) type protease and lipase-like autotransporters do not tend to contain PATR motifs.	28	CL0268	Passenger-associated-transport-repeat	Pectate lyase-like beta helix

Bacteriocins are diffusible proteins that parasitize cell-envelope proteins to enter and kill bacteria. Contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI) is one mechanism of inter-bacterial competition. Novel Toxin 21 (alternatively 16S rRNA endonuclease CdiA) belongs to a family of prokaryotic polymorphic toxin systems implicated in intra-specific conflicts. This RNase toxin found in bacterial polymorphic toxin systems, is proposed to adopt the BECR (Barnase-EndoU-ColicinE5/D-RelE) fold, with two conserved lysine residues and [DS]xDxxxH, RxG[ST] and RxxD motifs. In bacterial polymorphic toxin systems, the toxin is usually exported by the type 2, type 4, type 5 or type 7 secretion systems. This is also referred to as the E. cloacae CdiAC. The CdiAC proteins carry a variety of sequence-diverse C-terminal domains, which represent a collection of distinct toxins. Many CdiA-CT toxins have nuclease activities. In accord with the structural homology, CdiA-CT cleaves 16S rRNA at the same site as colicin E3 and this nuclease activity is responsible for growth inhibition.	71		Novel toxin 21	Novel toxin 21

This is the C-terminal domain found in eukaryotic UCH37 proteins (also known as Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase isozyme L5, UCHL5).

06645			429050	113	2.0094232347154646e-06	SPC12	Microsomal signal peptidase 12 kDa subunit (SPC12). This family consists of several microsomal signal peptidase 12 kDa subunit proteins. Translocation of polypeptide chains across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane is triggered by signal sequences. Subsequently, signal recognition particle interacts with its membrane receptor and the ribosome-bound nascent chain is targeted to the ER where it is transferred into a protein-conducting channel. At some point, a second signal sequence recognition event takes place in the membrane and translocation of the nascent chain through the membrane occurs. The signal sequence of most secretory and membrane proteins is cleaved off at this stage. Cleavage occurs by the signal peptidase complex (SPC) as soon as the lumenal domain of the translocating polypeptide is large enough to expose its cleavage site to the enzyme. The signal peptidase complex is possibly also involved in proteolytic events in the ER membrane other than the processing of the signal sequence, for example the further digestion of the cleaved signal peptide or the degradation of membrane proteins. Mammalian signal peptidase is as a complex of five different polypeptide chains. This family represents the 12 kDa subunit (SPC12).	65		Microsomal signal peptidase 12 kDa subunit (SPC12)	Microsomal signal peptidase 12 kDa subunit (SPC12)

18517			436555	113	2.0094232347154646e-06	LZ3wCH	Leucine zipper with capping helix domain. This domain is found at the C-terminal region of Hop2 and Mnd1 proteins. In meiotic DNA recombination, the Hop2-Mnd1 complex promotes Dmc1-mediated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) invasion into homologous chromosomes to form a synaptic complex. Hop2 (for homologous pairing; also known as TBPIP) is expressed specifically during meiosis, same as Mnd1 (for meiotic nuclear divisions 1). The C-terminal region of both Hop2 and Mnd1, folds into three alpha-helices that are interrupted by two short non-helical regions. These alpha-helices of the two proteins together form a parallel coiled coil that provides the major interface for heterodimer formation. The non-helical regions form substantially kinked junctions between adjacent leucine zippers: the LZ1-LZ2 and LZ2-LZ3 junctions.This domain is the C-terminal segment of Hop2 and Mnd1 which folds back onto the C-terminal leucine zipper (LZ3) to form a helical bundle-like structure, hence designated LZ3wCH (for LZ3 with capping helices). The LZ3wCH region plays a role in interacting with the Dmc1 nucleofilament.	55		Leucine zipper with capping helix domain	Leucine zipper with capping helix domain

The function and localization of minor pseudo-pilins are still to be fully unraveled. It has been suggested that some minor pseudopilins may assemble either into the base or the tip of pili, or both. They function as initiators or regulators of pilus biogenesis and dynamics, and/or as adaptors between various pseudopilin component and other members of the T2SS.	108	CL0327	Type II transport protein GspH	Pilus subunit

They are found in blood coagulation proteins such as fibrillin, Clr and Cls, thrombomodulin, and the LDL receptor. The core fold of the EGF domain consists of two small beta-hairpins packed against each other. Two major structural variants have been identified based on the structural context of the C-terminal cysteine residue of disulfide 'c' in the C-terminal hairpin: hEGFs and cEGFs. In cEGFs the C-terminal thiol resides on the C-terminal beta-sheet, resulting in long loop-lengths between the cysteine residues of disulfide 'c', typically C[10+]XC. These longer loop-lengths may have arisen by selective cysteine loss from a four-disulfide EGF template such as laminin or integrin. Tandem cEGF domains have five linking residues between terminal cysteines of adjacent domains. cEGF domains may or may not bind calcium in the linker region. cEGF domains with the consensus motif CXN4X[F,Y]XCXC are hydroxylated exclusively on the asparagine residue.	24	CL0001	Complement Clr-like EGF-like	EGF superfamily

This family contains the transcription factor E2F and its dimerization partners TDP1 and TDP2, which stimulate E2F-dependent transcription. E2F binds to DNA as a homodimer or as a heterodimer in association with TDP1/2, the heterodimer having increased binding efficiency. The crystal structure of an E2F4-DP2-DNA complex shows that the DNA-binding domains of the E2F and DP proteins both have a fold related to the winged-helix DNA-binding motif. Recognition of the central c/gGCGCg/c sequence of the consensus DNA-binding site is symmetric, and amino acids that contact these bases are conserved among all known E2F and DP proteins.	65	CL0123	E2F/DP family winged-helix DNA-binding domain	Helix-turn-helix clan

TetR family regulators are involved in the transcriptional control of multidrug efflux pumps, pathways for the biosynthesis of antibiotics, response to osmotic stress and toxic chemicals, control of catabolic pathways, differentiation processes, and pathogenicity. The TetR proteins identified in overm ultiple genera of bacteria and archaea share a common helix-turn-helix (HTH) structure in their DNA-binding domain. However, TetR proteins can work in different ways: they can bind a target operator directly to exert their effect (e.g. TetR binds Tet(A) gene to repress it in the absence of tetracycline), or they can be involved in complex regulatory cascades in which the TetR protein can either be modulated by another regulator or TetR can trigger the cellular response. TetR regulates the expression of the membrane-associated tetracycline resistance protein, TetA, which exports the tetracycline antibiotic out of the cell before it can attach to the ribosomes and inhibit protein synthesis. TetR blocks transcription from the genes encoding both TetA and TetR in the absence of antibiotic. The C-terminal domain is multi-helical and is interlocked in the homodimer with the helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding domain. This entry represents the C-terminal domain present in the Pseudomonas aeruginosa PsrA which regulates the fadBA5 beta-oxidation operon. Functional analysis of PsrA indicated its importance in regulating b-oxidative enzymes. It has also been suggested that PsrA, a member of the TetR family of repressors, could affect global gene expression including activation of rpoS.	113	CL0174	Tetracyclin repressor-like, C-terminal domain	TetR protein, C-terminal domain-like

This is a family of apparent calmodulin-binding proteins found at high levels in the testis and vomeronasal organ and at lower levels in certain other tissues. Enkurin is a scaffold protein that binds PI3 kinase to sperm transient receptor potential (canonical) (TRPC) channels. The mammalian transient receptor potential (canonical) channels are the primary candidates for the Ca(2+) entry pathway activated by the hormones, growth factors, and neurotransmitters that exert their effect through activation of PLC. Calmodulin binds to the C-terminus of all TRPC channels, and dissociation of calmodulin from TRPC4 results in profound activation of the channel.	92		Calmodulin-binding	Calmodulin-binding

This is C-terminal domain (CTD) of M60-peptidases pfam13402. It Can also be found at the C-terminal region of gingipain B (RgpB) from P. gingivalis. It was found to possess a typical Ig-like fold encompassing seven antiparallel beta-strands organized in two beta-sheets, packed into a beta-sandwich structure that can spontaneously dimerize through C-terminal strand swapping. Translocation of gingipains from the periplasm across the OM is dependent on the conserved CTD, which appears to be important for secretion of the proteins and in particular, truncation of the last few C-terminal residues of this domain leads to accumulation of gingipains in the periplasm. Subsequently, the T9SS targeting signal was demonstrated to reside within the last 22 residues at the C-terminus of the CTD. During gingipain translocation across the OM, the CTD is cleaved off by PorU.	65	CL0556	Peptidase M60 C-terminal domain	PapD-like superfamily,immunoglobulin-like beta sandwich

TetR family regulators are involved in the transcriptional control of multidrug efflux pumps, pathways for the biosynthesis of antibiotics, response to osmotic stress and toxic chemicals, control of catabolic pathways, differentiation processes, and pathogenicity. The TetR proteins identified in overm ultiple genera of bacteria and archaea share a common helix-turn-helix (HTH) structure in their DNA-binding domain. However, TetR proteins can work in different ways: they can bind a target operator directly to exert their effect (e.g. TetR binds Tet(A) gene to repress it in the absence of tetracycline), or they can be involved in complex regulatory cascades in which the TetR protein can either be modulated by another regulator or TetR can trigger the cellular response. TetR regulates the expression of the membrane-associated tetracycline resistance protein, TetA, which exports the tetracycline antibiotic out of the cell before it can attach to the ribosomes and inhibit protein synthesis. TetR blocks transcription from the genes encoding both TetA and TetR in the absence of antibiotic. The C-terminal domain is multi-helical and is interlocked in the homodimer with the helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding domain. This entry represents the C-terminal domain present the transcriptional regulator KstR that regulates a large set of genes responsible for cholesterol catabolism. This is important for Mycobacterium tuberculosis during infection, both at an early stage in the macrophage phagosome and later within the necrotic granuloma.	107	CL0174	Tetracyclin repressor-like, C-terminal domain	TetR protein, C-terminal domain-like

This domain has a KH-type fold and contains the absolutely conserved Glu-187, which stabilizes the binding of Mg2+ and hence polarizes the P=O bond for hydrolysis. A major feature of the CinA in T. thermophiles structure is the asymmetry in the dimer, which is caused by contact between a KH-type domain on the opposite chain and the bound ADP-ribose. This has the effect of closing the active site, allowing additional recognition of ADP-ribose by residues from the KH-type domain.	73		Damage-inducible protein CinA KH domain	Damage-inducible protein CinA KH domain

The Sh3-like domain in Xrn1 lacks the canonical SH3 residues normally involved in binding proline-rich peptide motifs and instead engages in non-canonical interactions with the catalytic domain. Additionally it is essential in maintaining the structural integrity of Xrn1, since partial truncation of this domain in yeast Xrn1 yields an inactive protein. There is a long loop projecting from the SH3-like domain that contacts the PAZ/Tudor domain, occluding the functional surface that binds RNA or peptide motifs containing methylated arginines, respectively, in canonical PAZ and Tudor domain.	68	CL0010	Xrn1 SH3-like domain	Src homology-3 domain

The Cox protein is a 79-residue basic protein with a predicted strong helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif. It inhibits integrative recombination and it activates site-specific excision of the HP1 genome from the Haemophilus influenzae chromosome, Hp1. Cox appears to function as a tetramer. Cox binding sites consist of two direct repeats of the consensus motif 5'-GGTMAWWWWA, one Cox tetramer binding to each motif. Cox binding interferes with the interaction of HP1 integrase with one of its binding sites, IBS5. This competition is central to directional control. Both Cox binding sites are needed for full inhibition of integration and for activating excision, because it plays a positive role in assembling the nucleoprotein complexes that produce excisive recombination, by inducing the formation of a critical conformation in those complexes.	87		Regulatory phage protein cox	Regulatory phage protein cox

This is an SH3 (SRC homology domain 3) domain found in RecD helicases (EC 3.6.4.12) that belong to the bacterial Superfamily 1B (SF1B). This superfamily of helicases translocate in a 5'-3' direction and are required for a range of cellular activities across all domains of life. Structural analysis indicate that the extension of the 5'-tail of the unwound DNA duplex induces a large conformational change in the RecD subunit, that is transferred through the RecC subunit to activate the nuclease domain of the RecB subunit. The process involves this SH3 domain that binds to a region of the RecB subunit. Studies of RecD in E. coli also revealed that the SH3 domain interacts with the ssDNA tail in a location different to that normally occupied by a peptide in canonical eukaryotic SH3 domains, thus retaining the potential to bind peptide at the same time as the ssDNA tail.	65	CL0010	ATP-dependent RecD-like DNA helicase SH3 domain	Src homology-3 domain

05931			368676	75	1.3336879876430077e-06	AgrD	Staphylococcal AgrD protein. This family consists of several AgrD proteins from many Staphylococcus species. The agr locus was initially described in Staphylococcus aureus as an element controlling the production of exoproteins implicated in virulence. Its pattern of action has been shown to be complex, upregulating certain extracellular toxins and enzymes expressed post-exponentially and repressing some exponential-phase surface components. AgrD encodes the precursor of the autoinducing peptide (AIP).The AIP derived from AgrD by the action of AgrB interacts with AgrC in the membrane to activate AgrA, which upregulates transcription both from promoter P2, amplifying the response, and from P3, initiating the production of a novel effector: RNAIII. In S. aureus, delta-hemolysin is the only translation product of RNA III and is not involved in the regulatory functions of the transcript, which is therefore the primary agent for modulating the expression of other operons controlled by agr.	45		Staphylococcal AgrD protein	Staphylococcal AgrD protein

GnsA and GnsB are multicopy suppressors of the secG null mutation. These proteins participate in the synthesis of phospholipids, suggesting the functional relationship between SecG and membrane phospholipids. Over-expression of gnsA and gnsB causes a remarkable increase in the unsaturated fatty acid content. However, the gnsA-gnsB double null mutant exhibits no effect. Both proteins are predicted to possess a helix-turn-helix structure.

03451			427302	74	1.3159054811411005e-06	HELP	HELP motif. The founding member of the EMAP protein family is the 75 kDa Echinoderm Microtubule-Associated Protein, so-named for its abundance in sea urchin, sand dollar and starfish eggs. The Hydrophobic EMAP-Like Protein (HELP) motif was identified initially in the human EMAP-Like Protein 2 (EML2) and subsequently in the entire EMAP Protein family. The HELP motif is approximately 60-70 amino acids in length and is conserved amongst metazoans. Although the HELP motif is hydrophobic, there is no evidence that EMAP-Like Proteins are membrane-associated. All members of the EMAP-Like Protein family, identified to-date, are constructed with an amino terminal HELP motif followed by a WD domain. In C. elegans, EMAP-Like Protein-1 (ELP-1) is required for touch sensation indicating that ELP-1 may play a role in mechanosensation. The localization of ELP-1 to microtubules and adhesion sites implies that ELP-1 may transmit forces between the body surface and the touch receptor neurons.	72		HELP motif	HELP motif

SQAPI, aspartic acid inhibitor first isolated from squash, inhibits a wide range of aspartic proteinases. This particular family of PAAPIs (proteinaceous aspartic acid inhibitors) seems to have evolved quite recently from an ancestral cystatin. Structurally it consists of a four-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet gripping an alpha-helix in much the same manner that a hand grips a tennis racket. The unstructured N-terminus and the loop connecting beta-strands 1 and 2 are important for pepsin inhibition, but the loop connecting strands 3 and 4 is not.	83	CL0121	Aspartic acid proteinase inhibitor	Cystatin-like superfamily

The U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U1 snRNP) binds to the pre-mRNA 5' splice site (ss) at early stages of spliceosome assembly. Recruitment of U1 to a class of weak 5' ss is promoted by binding of the protein TIA-1 to uridine-rich sequences immediately downstream from the 5' ss. Binding of TIA-1 in the vicinity of a 5' ss helps to stabilize U1 snRNP recruitment, at least in part, via a direct interaction with U1-C, thus providing one molecular mechanism for the function of this splicing regulator. This domain is probably a zinc-binding. It is found in multiple copies in some members of the family.	38	CL0361	U1 zinc finger	Classical C2H2 and C2HC zinc fingers

17334			407439	72	1.280340468137287e-06	CsgA	Sigma-G-dependent sporulation-specific SASP protein. Curli are extracellular functional amyloids that are assembled by enteric bacteria during biofilm formation and host colonization. The csg (curli specific gene) operon encodes major structural and accessory proteins that are required for curli production. The csgBAC operon encodes the major and minor curli fiber components, CsgA and CsgB, respectively. CsgA is secreted to the extracellular milieu as an unfolded protein and forms amyloid polymers upon interacting with the CsgB nucleator. CsgA is comprised of five imperfect repeating units with highly conserved glutamine and asparagine residues that are important for amyloid formation. Each repeating unit is predicted to form a strand-loop-strand motif. In vitro, CsgC inhibits CsgA amyloid formation at substoichiometric concentrations and maintains CsgA in a non-beta-sheet rich conformation, making CsgC an efficient and selective amyloid inhibitor.	83		Minor curli fiber component A	Minor curli fiber component A

14777			434202	69	1.2269929486315667e-06	BBIP10	Cilia BBSome complex subunit 10. The BBSome (so-named after the association with Bardet-Biedl syndrome) is a complex of 8 subunits that lies at the base of the flagellar microtubule structure. The precise function of all the individual components in cilia formation is unclear, however they function to promote loading of cargo to the ciliary axoneme. BBIP10 localizes to the primary cilium, and is present exclusively in ciliated organisms. It is required for cytoplasmic microtubule polymerization and acetylation, two functions not shared with any other BBSome subunits. BBIP10 physically interacts with HDAC6. BBSome-bound BBIP10 may therefore function to couple acetylation of axonemal microtubules and ciliary membrane growth. The primary cilium, a slim microtubule-based organelle that projects from the surface of vertebrate cells has crucial roles in vertebrate development and human genetic diseases. Cilia are required for the response to developmental signals, and evidence is accumulating that the primary cilium is specialized for Hedgehog (Hh) signal transduction. Formation of cilia, in turn, is regulated by other signalling pathways, possibly including the planar cell polarity pathway. The connections between cilia and developmental signalling have begun to clarify the basis of human diseases associated with ciliary dysfunction.	63		Cilia BBSome complex subunit 10	Cilia BBSome complex subunit 10

This is a family of bacteriocidal bacteriocins secreted by Streptococcal species in order to kill off closely-related competitor Gram-positives. The sequence includes the peptide precursor, this being cleaved off proteolytically at the double-glycine. The family does not carry the YGNGVXC motif characteristic of pediocin-like Bacteriocins, Bacteriocin_II pfam01721. The producer bacteria are protected from the effects of their own bacteriocins by production of a specific immunity protein which is co-transcribed with the genes encoding the bacteriocins, eg family EntA_Immun pfam08951. The bacteriocins are structurally more specific than their immunity-protein counterparts. Typically, production of the bacteriocin gene is from within an operon carrying up to 6 genes including a typical two-component regulatory system (R and H), a small peptide pheromone (C), and a dedicated ABC transporter (A and -B) as well as an immunity protein. The ABC transporter is thought to recognize the N termini of both the pheromone and the bacteriocins and to transport these peptides across the cytoplasmic membrane, concurrent with cleavage at the conserved double-glycine motif. Cleaved extracellular C can then bind to the sensor kinase, H, resulting in activation of R and up-regulation of the entire gene cluster via binding to consensus sequences within each promoter. It seems likely that this whole regulon is carried on a transmissible plasmid which is passed between closely related Firmicute species since many clinical isolates from different Firmicutes can produce at least two bacteriocins. and the same bacteriocins can be produced by different species.	58	CL0400	Bacteriocin class II with double-glycine leader peptide	Double-Glycine leader-peptide cleavage motif

CBM60 is a family of xylan-binding modules found in conjunction with xylanase enzymes in many bacterial species that attack plant cell walls. Xylan is the major hemicellulose component of most plant cell walls, and is one of the most complex carbohydrates targeted by CBMs. CBM60 modules are evolutionarily related to CBM36 domains as both show circular permutation in the beta-barrel folds. CBM60 targets xylan but is also able to bind cellulose and galactan and thus contribute towards breakdown of the plant cell wall. Recognition of the ligand is conferred primarily through the polar interactions of O2 (oxygen) and O3 of a single sugar with a protein-bound calcium ion.	93	CL0202	Ca-dependent carbohydrate-binding module xylan-binding	Galactose-binding domain-like superfamily

This family contains a number of related ligase enzymes which have EC numbers 6.3.2.*. This family includes: MurC, MurD, MurE, MurF, Mpl, and FolC. MurC, MurD, Mure and MurF catalyze consecutive steps in the synthesis of peptidoglycan. Peptidoglycan consists of a sheet of two sugar derivatives, with one of these N-acetylmuramic acid attaching to a small pentapeptide. The pentapeptide is is made of L-alanine, D-glutamic acid, Meso-diaminopimelic acid and D-alanyl alanine. The peptide moiety is synthesized by successively adding these amino acids to UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid. MurC transfers the L-alanine, MurD transfers the D-glutamate, MurE transfers the diaminopimelic acid, and MurF transfers the D-alanyl alanine.

Eukaryotic N-glycosylation is catalyzed in the ER lumen, where the enzyme oligosaccharyltransferase (OTase) transfers donor glycans from a dolichol pyrophosphate (DolP) carrier (Lipid-linked oligosaccharide; LLO) to polypeptides. The yeast OTase is a hetero-oligomeric complex composed of essential (Ost1, Ost2, Wbp1, Stt3, and Swp1) and nonessential (Ost3, Ost4, Ost5, and Ost6) subunits. This domain family is found in Ost5. The precise function of this subunit is not known, however Ost5 appears to form a sub-complex with Ost1, and this sub-complex associates with the catalytic Stt3 subunit of OTase. Down regulation of Ost5 resulted in a limited effect on glycosylation and no effect on the stability of Ost1 or Stt3 subunits.	73		Oligosaccharyltransferase subunit 5	Oligosaccharyltransferase subunit 5
12703			403795	60	1.066950390114406e-06	ptaRNA1_toxin	Toxin of toxin-antitoxin type 1 system. This family is the toxin of a type 1 toxin-antitoxin system which is found in a relatively widespread range of bacterial species. The species distribution suggests frequent horizontal gene transfer. In a type 1 system, as characterized for the plasmid-encoded E coli hok/sok system, the toxin-encoding stable mRNA encodes a protein which rapidly leads to cell death unless the translation is suppressed by a short-lived small RNA. The plasmid-encoded module prevents the growth of plasmid-free offspring, thus ensuring the persistence of the plasmid in the population. Plasmid-free cells arising after cell-division will be killed because the stable mRNA toxin is present while the comparably unstable anti-toxin is rapidly degraded. Where the system is transcribed chromosomally, the mechanism is poorly understood.	73		Toxin of toxin-antitoxin type 1 system	Toxin of toxin-antitoxin type 1 system

CDC26 is one of the nine or so subunits identified within APC but its exact function is not known. The APC/C becomes active at the metaphase/anaphase transition and remains active during G1 phase. One mechanism linked to activation of the APC/C is phosphorylation. The yeast APC/C is composed of at least 13 subunits, but the function of many of the subunits is unknown. Hcn1 is the smallest subunit of the S. pombe APC/C, and is found to be essential for cell viability, APC/C integrity, and proper APC/C regulation.

TetR family regulators are involved in the transcriptional control of multidrug efflux pumps, pathways for the biosynthesis of antibiotics, response to osmotic stress and toxic chemicals, control of catabolic pathways, differentiation processes, and pathogenicity. The TetR proteins identified in overm ultiple genera of bacteria and archaea share a common helix-turn-helix (HTH) structure in their DNA-binding domain. However, TetR proteins can work in different ways: they can bind a target operator directly to exert their effect (e.g. TetR binds Tet(A) gene to repress it in the absence of tetracycline), or they can be involved in complex regulatory cascades in which the TetR protein can either be modulated by another regulator or TetR can trigger the cellular response. TetR regulates the expression of the membrane-associated tetracycline resistance protein, TetA, which exports the tetracycline antibiotic out of the cell before it can attach to the ribosomes and inhibit protein synthesis. TetR blocks transcription from the genes encoding both TetA and TetR in the absence of antibiotic. The C-terminal domain is multi-helical and is interlocked in the homodimer with the helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding domain. This entry represents the C-terminal domain present the TetR Transcriptional Repressor found in Streptomyces coelicolor A3.

10528	PA14	PA14 superfamily	431339	55	9.780378576048722e-07	GLEYA	GLEYA domain. The GLEYA domain is related to lectin-like binding domains found in the S. cerevisiae Flo proteins and the C. glabrata Epa proteins. It is a carbohydrate-binding domain that is found in fungal adhesins (also referred to as agglutinins or flocculins). Adhesins with a GLEYA domain possess a typical N-terminal signal peptide and a domain of conserved sequence repeats, but lack glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor attachment signals. They contain a conserved motif G(M/L)(E/A/N/Q)YA, hence the name GLEYA. Based on sequence homology, it is suggested that the GLEYA domain would predominantly contain beta sheets. The GLEYA domain is also found in S. pombe putative cell agglutination protein fta5, thought to be a kinetochore portein (Sim4 complex subunit), however no direct evidence for kinetochore association has been found. Furthermore, a global protein localization study in S. pombe identified it as a secreted protein localized to the Golgi complex.	91	CL0301	GLEYA domain	PA14 superfamily

This family, many of whose members are YcbG, organizes the macrodomain Ter of the chromosome of bacteria such as E coli. In these bacteria, insulated macrodomains influence the segregation of sister chromatids and the mobility of chromosomal DNA. Organisation of the Terminus region (Ter) into a macrodomain relies on the presence of a 13 bp motif called matS repeated 23 times in the 800-kb-long domain. MatS sites are the main targets in the E. coli chromosome of YcbG or MatP (macrodomain Ter protein). MatP accumulates in the cell as a discrete focus that co-localizes with the Ter macrodomain. The effects of MatP inactivation reveal its role as the main organizer of the Ter macrodomain: in the absence of MatP, DNA is less compacted, the mobility of markers is increased, and segregation of the Ter macrodomain occurs early in the cell cycle. A specific organisational system is required in the Terminus region for bacterial chromosome management during the cell cycle.

14689			434130	52	9.246903380991518e-07	SPOB_a	Sensor_kinase_SpoOB-type, alpha-helical domain. Sporulation initiation phospho-transferase B or SpoOB is part of a phospho-relay that initiates sporulation in Bacillus subtilis. Spo0B is a two-domain protein consisting of an N-terminal alpha-helical hairpin domain and a C-terminal alpha/beta domain. Two subunits of Spo0B dimerize by a parallel association of helical hairpins to form a novel four-helix bundle from which the active histidine - involved in the auto-phosphorylation - protrudes. In the phospho-relay, the signal-receptor histidine kinases are dephosphorylated by a common response regulator, Spo0F. Spo0B then takes phosphorylated Spo0F as substrate thereby mediating the transfer of a phosphoryl group to Spo0A, the ultimate transcription factor. The exact function of this alpha-helical domain is not known; it does not always occur just as the N-terminal domain of SPOB_ab, pfam14682. SCOP describes this domain as a histidine kinase-like fold lacking the kinase ATP-binding site.	62		Sensor_kinase_SpoOB-type, alpha-helical domain	Sensor_kinase_SpoOB-type

This is the first TUDOR domain found in SETDB1 enzymes (EC:2.1.1.43) in homosapiens, also known as Eggless in Drosophila. In Drosophila, SetdB1 (Egg) is important for oogenesis and the silencing of chromosome 4. SET domain, bifurcated 1 (SETDB1) is a histone methyltransferase (HMT) that methylates lysine 9 on histone H3 (H3K9). The enzymatic activity of SETDB1, in association with MBD1-containing chromatin-associated factor 1 (MCAF1), converts H3K9me2 to H3K9me3 and represses subsequent transcription. SETDB1 is amplified in cancers such as melanoma and lung cancer, and increased expression of SETDB1 promotes tumorigenesis in a zebrafish melanoma model. In addition, SETDB1 is required for endogenous retrovirus silencing during early embryogenesis, inhibition of adipocyte differentiation, and differentiation of mesenchymal cells into osteoblasts.

TetR family regulators are involved in the transcriptional control of multidrug efflux pumps, pathways for the biosynthesis of antibiotics, response to osmotic stress and toxic chemicals, control of catabolic pathways, differentiation processes, and pathogenicity. The TetR proteins identified in overm ultiple genera of bacteria and archaea share a common helix-turn-helix (HTH) structure in their DNA-binding domain. However, TetR proteins can work in different ways: they can bind a target operator directly to exert their effect (e.g. TetR binds Tet(A) gene to repress it in the absence of tetracycline), or they can be involved in complex regulatory cascades in which the TetR protein can either be modulated by another regulator or TetR can trigger the cellular response. TetR regulates the expression of the membrane-associated tetracycline resistance protein, TetA, which exports the tetracycline antibiotic out of the cell before it can attach to the ribosomes and inhibit protein synthesis. TetR blocks transcription from the genes encoding both TetA and TetR in the absence of antibiotic. The C-terminal domain is multi-helical and is interlocked in the homodimer with the helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding domain.

TetR family regulators are involved in the transcriptional control of multidrug efflux pumps, pathways for the biosynthesis of antibiotics, response to osmotic stress and toxic chemicals, control of catabolic pathways, differentiation processes, and pathogenicity. The TetR proteins identified in overm ultiple genera of bacteria and archaea share a common helix-turn-helix (HTH) structure in their DNA-binding domain. However, TetR proteins can work in different ways: they can bind a target operator directly to exert their effect (e.g. TetR binds Tet(A) gene to repress it in the absence of tetracycline), or they can be involved in complex regulatory cascades in which the TetR protein can either be modulated by another regulator or TetR can trigger the cellular response. TetR regulates the expression of the membrane-associated tetracycline resistance protein, TetA, which exports the tetracycline antibiotic out of the cell before it can attach to the ribosomes and inhibit protein synthesis. TetR blocks transcription from the genes encoding both TetA and TetR in the absence of antibiotic. The C-terminal domain is multi-helical and is interlocked in the homodimer with the helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding domain. This entry represents the C-terminal domain present the TetR Transcriptional Repressor present in sco1712 proteins from Streptomyces coelicolo which act as a regulator of antibiotic production.	113	CL0174	Tetracyclin repressor-like, C-terminal domain	TetR protein, C-terminal domain-like

04002	JAB	JAB-like superfamily	427643	40	7.113002600762706e-07	RadC	RadC-like JAB domain. A family of proteins present widely across the bacteria. This family was named initially with reference to the E. coli radC102 mutation which suggested that RadC was involved in repair of DNA lesions. However the relevant mutation has subsequently been shown to be in recG, where radC is in fact an allele of recG. In addition, a personal communication from Claverys, J-P, et al, indicates a total failure of all attempts to characterize a radiation-related function for RadC in Streptococcus pneumoniae, suggesting that it is not involved in repair of DNA lesions, in recombination during transformation, in gene conversion, nor in mismatch repair. Computational analysis, however, provides a possible function. The RadC-like family belong to the JAB superfamily of metalloproteins. The domain shows fusions to an N-terminal Helix-hairpin-Helix (HhH) domain in most instances. Other domain combinations include fusions to the anti-restriction module ArdC, the DinG/RAD3-like superfamily II helicases and the DNAG-like primase. In some bacteria, closely related DinG/Rad3- like superfamily II helicases are fused to a 3'-5' exonuclease in the same position as the RadC-like JAB domain. These conserved domain associations lead to the hypothesis that the RadC-like JAB domains might function as a nuclease.	113	CL0366	RadC-like JAB domain	JAB-like superfamily

This family represents the N-terminal region of the eukaryotic epoxide hydrolase protein. Epoxide hydrolases (EC:3.3.2.3) comprise a group of functionally related enzymes that catalyze the addition of water to oxirane compounds (epoxides), thereby usually generating vicinal trans-diols. EHs have been found in all types of living organisms, including mammals, invertebrates, plants, fungi and bacteria. In animals, the major interest in EH is directed towards their detoxification capacity for epoxides since they are important safeguards against the cytotoxic and genotoxic potential of oxirane derivatives that are often reactive electrophiles because of the high tension of the three-membered ring system and the strong polarization of the C--O bonds. This is of significant relevance because epoxides are frequent intermediary metabolites which arise during the biotransformation of foreign compounds.

CbeA_antitoxin is a family of cognate antitoxins to the CbtA toxins that act by inhibiting the polymerization of cytoskeletal proteins, see pfam06755. These are classified as a type IV toxin-antitoxin system. The family includes three proteins from E. coli YagB, YeeU and YfjZ, which act not by forming a complex with CbtA but through acting as antagonists to the CbtA toxicity, by stabilizing the CbtA target proteins. For example, YeeU binds directly to both MreB and FtsZ and enhances the bundling of their filaments in vitro. YeeU is also able to neutralize the toxicity caused by other MreB and FtsZ inhibitors, such as A22 [S-(3, 4-dichlorobenzyl)isothiourea] for MreB, and SulA and DicB for FtsZ. Thus CbeA, for cytoskeleton bundling-enhancing factor A, is proposed as a general name for all of these antitoxin proteins.	101		CbeA_antitoxin, type IV, cytoskeleton bundling-enhancing factor A	CbeA_antitoxin

01825	Gain	GPCR autoproteolysis inducing	426458	37	6.579527405705502e-07	GPS	GPCR proteolysis site, GPS, motif. The GPS motif is found in GPCRs, and is the site for auto-proteolysis, so is thus named, GPS. The GPS motif is a conserved sequence of ~40 amino acids containing canonical cysteine and tryptophan residues, and is the most highly conserved part of the domain. In most, if not all, cell-adhesion GPCRs these undergo autoproteolysis in the GPS between a conserved aliphatic residue (usually a leucine) and a threonine, serine, or cysteine residue. In higher eukaryotes this motif is found embedded in the C-terminal beta-stranded part of a GAIN domain - GPCR-Autoproteolysis INducing (GAIN). The GAIN-GPS domain adopts a fold in which the GPS motif, at the C-terminus, forms five beta-strands that are tightly integrated into the overall GAIN domain. The GPS motif, evolutionarily conserved from tetrahymena to mammals, is the only extracellular domain shared by all human cell-adhesion GPCRs and PKD proteins, and is the locus of multiple human disease mutations. The GAIN-GPS domain is both necessary and sufficient functionally for autoproteolysis, suggesting an autoproteolytic mechanism whereby the overall GAIN domain fine-tunes the chemical environment in the GPS to catalyze peptide bond hydrolysis. In the cell-adhesion GPCRs and PKD proteins, the GPS motif is always located at the end of their long N-terminal extracellular regions, immediately before the first transmembrane helix of the respective protein.	46	CL0661	GPCR proteolysis site, GPS, motif	GPCR autoproteolysis inducing

08695	NTF2	NTF2-like superfamily	430157	36	6.401702340686435e-07	Coa1	Cytochrome oxidase complex assembly protein 1. Coa1 is an inner mitochondrial membrane protein that associates with Shy1 and is required for cytochrome oxidase complex IV assembly. It contains a conserved hydrophobic segment (amino acids 74-92) with the potential to form a membrane-spanning helix. The N-terminus of Coa1 is rich in positively charged amino acids and could form an amphipathic alpha helix, characteristic of a mitochondrial presequence. A cleavage site for the mitochondrial processing peptidase is predicted adjacent to the presequence. Upon in vitro import into mitochondria, Coa1 is processed to a mature form, indicating that it possesses a cleavable presequence. The eukaryotic cytochrome oxidase complex consists of 12-13 subunits, with three mitochondrial encoded subunits, Cox1-Cox3, forming the core enzyme.

Synechocystis sp. cbiH represents a fusion between cbiH and cbiG. As other multi-functional proteins involved in cobalamin biosynthesis catalyze adjacent steps in the pathway, including CysG, CobL (CbiET), CobIJ and CobA-HemD, it is therefore possible that CbiG catalyzes a reaction step adjacent to CbiH.

In the pneumococcus cell division, MapZ (Midcell Anchored Protein Z) locates at the division site before FtsZ and guides septum positioning. MapZ forms ring structures at the cell equator and moves apart as the cell elongates, therefore behaving as a permanent beacon of division sites. MapZ then positions the FtsZ-ring through direct protein-protein interactions. Structural analysis indicate that it displays a bi-modular structure composed of two subdomains separated by a flexible serine-rich linker. The extracellular C-terminal domain carries a conserved patch of amino acids which plays a crucial function in binding peptidoglycan and positioning MapZ at the cell equator.	94		MapZ extracellular C-terminal domain 2	MapZ extracellular C-terminal domain 2

12350			432498	33	5.868227145629232e-07	CTK3_C	CTD kinase subunit gamma CTK3 C-terminus. The C-terminal domain kinase (CTDK-1), is a three-subunit complex comprised of Ctk1, Ctk2, and Ctk3, that plays a key role in regulation of transcription and translation and in coordinating these two processes. Both Ctk2 and Ctk3 are regulated at the level of protein turnover, and are unstable proteins processed through a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Their physical interaction is required to protect both subunits from degradation, and both Ctk2 and Ctk3 are required for Ctk1 CTD kinase activation. The mammalian P-TEFb is mirrored by the combined complexes in yeast of the CTDK1 and the Bur1/2. It is not clear what independent function this C-terminal domain has.	59		CTD kinase subunit gamma CTK3 C-terminus	CTD kinase subunit gamma CTK3 C-terminus

04352			427887	31	5.512577015591097e-07	ProQ	ProQ/FINO family. This family includes ProQ, which is required for full activation of the osmoprotectant transporter, ProP, in Escherichia coli. This family includes several bacterial fertility inhibition (FINO) proteins. The conjugative transfer of F-like plasmids is repressed by FinO, an RNA binding protein.

FtsH is the only membrane-bound ATP-dependent protease universally conserved in prokaryotes. It only efficiently degrades proteins that have a low thermodynamic stability - e.g. it lacks robust unfoldase activity. This feature may be key and implies that this could be a criterion for degrading a protein. In Oenococcus oeni FtsH is involved in protection against environmental stress, and shows increased expression under heat or osmotic stress. These two lines of evidence suggest that it is a fundamental prokaryotic self-protection mechanism that checks if proteins are correctly folded (personal obs: Yeats C). The precise function of this N-terminal region is unclear.	103		FtsH Extracellular	FtsH Extracellular

03862			427551	30	5.33475195057203e-07	SpoVAC_SpoVAEB	SpoVAC/SpoVAEB sporulation membrane protein. Members of this family are all transcribed from the spoVA operon. Bacillus and Clostridium are two well studied endospore forming bacteria. Spore formation provides a resistance mechanism in response to extreme or unfavourable environmental conditions such as heat, radiation, and chemical agents or nutrient deprivation. The reverse process termed germination takes place where spores develop into growing cells in response to nutrient availability or stress reduction. Nutrient germinant receptors (GRs) and the SpoVA proteins are important players in the germination process. In B.subtilis the SpoVAC and SpoVAEB, belonging to this domain family, are predicted to be membrane proteins, with two to five membrane spanning. Biophysical and biochemical studies suggest that SpoVAC acts as a mechano-sensitive channel with properties that would allow the release of Ca-DPA (dipicolinic acid) and amino acids during germination of the spore. The release of Ca-DPA is a crucial event during spore germination. When expressed in E.coli SpoVAC provides protection against osmotic downshift. Furthermore, SpoVAC acts as channel that facilitates the efflux down the concentration gradient of osmolytes up to a mass of at least 600 Da. Another conserved SpoVA protein in all spore-forming bacteria is SpoVAEb, which appears to be an integral membrane protein with no known function.	116		SpoVAC/SpoVAEB sporulation membrane protein	SpoVAC/SpoVAEB sporulation membrane protein

01641	Beta-tent	Beta-tent fold	426361	29	5.156926885552961e-07	SelR	SelR domain. Methionine sulfoxide reduction is an important process, by which cells regulate biological processes and cope with oxidative stress. MsrA, a protein involved in the reduction of methionine sulfoxides in proteins, has been known for four decades and has been extensively characterized with respect to structure and function. However, recent studies revealed that MsrA is only specific for methionine-S-sulfoxides. Because oxidized methionines occur in a mixture of R and S isomers in vivo, it was unclear how stereo-specific MsrA could be responsible for the reduction of all protein methionine sulfoxides. It appears that a second methionine sulfoxide reductase, SelR, evolved that is specific for methionine-R-sulfoxides, the activity that is different but complementary to that of MsrA. Thus, these proteins, working together, could reduce both stereoisomers of methionine sulfoxide. This domain is found both in SelR proteins and fused with the peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase enzymatic domain pfam01625. The domain has two conserved cysteine and histidines. The domain binds both selenium and zinc. The final cysteine is found to be replaced by the rare amino acid selenocysteine in some members of the family.

05741			428612	28	4.979101820533897e-07	zf-nanos	Nanos RNA binding domain. This family consists of several conserved novel zinc finger domains found in the eukaryotic proteins Nanos and Xcat-2. In Drosophila melanogaster, Nanos functions as a localized determinant of posterior pattern. Nanos RNA is localized to the posterior pole of the maturing egg cell and encodes a protein that emanates from this localized source. Nanos acts as a translational repressor and thereby establishes a gradient of the morphogen Hunchback. Xcat-2 is found in the vegetal cortical region and is inherited by the vegetal blasomeres during development, and is degraded very early in development. The localized and maternally restricted expression of Xcat-2 RNA suggests a role for its protein in setting up regional differences in gene expression that occur early in development.	54		Nanos RNA binding domain	Nanos RNA binding domain

Pirin is known to be a nuclear protein, exclusively localized within the nucleoplasma and predominantly concentrated within dot-like subnuclear structures. A tomato homolog of human Pirin has been found to be induced during programmed cell death. Human Pirin interacts with Bcl-3 and NFI and hence is probably involved in the regulation of DNA transcription and replication.

This bacterial family of integral membrane proteins represents a positive regulator of the sigma(E) transcription factor, namely RseC/MucC. The sigma(E) transcription factor is up-regulated by cell envelope protein misfolding, and regulates the expression of genes that are collectively termed ECF (devoted to Extra-Cellular Functions). In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, de-repression of sigma(E) is associated with the alginate-overproducing phenotype characteristic of chronic respiratory tract colonisation in cystic fibrosis patients. The mechanism by which RseC/MucC positively regulates the sigma(E) transcription factor is unknown. RseC is also thought to have a role in thiamine biosynthesis in Salmonella typhimurium. In addition, this family also includes an N-terminal part of RnfF, a Rhodobacter capsulatus protein, of unknown function, that is essential for nitrogen fixation.

TUG has an N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain (UBL1) which in similar proteins appears to participate in protein-protein interactions. The region does have a area of negative electrostatic potential and increased backbone motility which leads to suggestions of a potential protein-protein interaction site.

Csp proteases (Csps) and the subtilase protease family Subtilases are serine proteases that contain a catalytic triad in the order of Asp, His and Ser. Structure analysis reveals that Csps are subtilisin-like proteases with two distinctive functional features: a central jellyroll domain and a retained prodomain. The prodomain adopts a similar fold to the prodomains of related subtilisin-like proteases with the C-terminal region extending deep into the catalytic cleft. However, unlike the majority of subtilisin-like proteases, the prodomain stays bound to the subtilase domain via a network of interactions that result in tighter prodomain binding relative to other subtilases. Finally the prodomain acts as both an intramolecular chaperone and an inhibitor of CspB protease activity.	89		Csp protease B prodomain	Csp protease B prodomain

In bacteria, the replication restart process is orchestrated by the PriA DNA helicase, which identifies replication forks via structure-specific DNA binding and interactions with fork-associated ssDNA-binding proteins (SSBs). The CRR region which is embedded within the C-terminal helicase lobe has been identified to bind two Zn2+ ions. This 50-residue insertion forms a structure on the surface of the helicase core in which two Zn2+ ions are coordinated by invariant Cys residues. Biochemical experiments have shown that sequence changes to Zn2+-binding Cys residues in the PriA CRR can eliminate helicase, but not ATPase, activity and can block assembly of PriB onto DNA-bound PriA, implicating the CRR in multiple functions in PriA.	27	CL0167	PriA DNA helicase Cys-rich region (CRR) domain	Zinc beta-ribbon

Energy-converting [NiFe] hydrogenases are membrane-bound enzymes with a six-subunit core: the large and small hydrogenase subunits, plus two hydrophilic proteins and two integral membrane proteins. Their large and small subunits show little sequence similarity to other [NiFe] hydrogenases, except for key conserved residues coordinating the active site and [FeS] cluster. Energy-converting [NiFe] hydrogenases function as ion pumps, catalyzing the reduction of ferredoxin with H2 driven by the proton-motive force or the sodium-ion-motive force. Eha and Ehb hydrogenases contain extra subunits in addition to those shared by other energy-converting [NiFe] hydrogenases (or [NiFe]-hydrogenase-3-type). Eha contains a 6[4Fe-4S] polyferredoxin, a 10[4F-4S] polyferredoxin, ten other predicted integral membrane proteins (EhaA, EhaB, EhaC, EhaD, EhaE, EhaF, EhaG, EhaI, EhaK, EhaL) and four hydrophobic subunits (EhaM, EhaR, EhS, EhT). Eha and Ehb catalyze the reduction of low-potential redox carriers (e.g. ferredoxins or polyferredoxins), which then might function as electron donors to oxidoreductases. Based on sequence similarity and genome context analysis, other organisms such as Methanopyrus kandleri, Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, and Methanothermobacter marburgensis also encode Eha-like [NiFe]-hydrogenase-3-type complexes and have very similar eha operon structure. This domain family can be found on the small membrane proteins that are predicted to be the EhaA trans-membrane subunits of multisubunit membrane-bound [NiFe]-hydrogenase Eha complexes.	94		NiFe-hydrogenase-type-3 Eha complex subunit A	NiFe-hydrogenase-type-3 Eha complex subunit A

The domain binds to Histone-4 methylated at lysine-20, H4K20me, suggesting that it is methyl-lysine recognition motif. Removal of two conserved aromatic residues in a hydrophobic cavity created by this domain within the full-length protein, Pdp1, abolishes the interaction o f the protein with H4K20me3. In fission yeast, Set9 is the sole enzyme that catalyzes all three states of H4K20me, and Set9-mediated H4K20me is required for efficient recruitment of checkpoint protein Crb2 to sites of DNA damage.

04568			428014	25	4.4456266254766903e-07	IATP	Mitochondrial ATPase inhibitor, IATP. ATP synthase inhibitor prevents the enzyme from switching to ATP hydrolysis during collapse of the electrochemical gradient, for example during oxygen deprivation ATP synthase inhibitor forms a one to one complex with the F1 ATPase, possibly by binding at the alpha-beta interface. It is thought to inhibit ATP synthesis by preventing the release of ATP. The minimum inhibitory region for bovine inhibitor is from residues 39 to 72. The inhibitor has two oligomeric states, dimer (the active state) and tetramer. At low pH, the inhibitor forms a dimer via antiparallel coiled coil interactions between the C terminal regions of two monomers. At high pH, the inhibitor forms tetramers and higher oligomers by coiled coil interactions involving the N-terminus and inhibitory region, thus preventing the inhibitory activity.	98		Mitochondrial ATPase inhibitor, IATP	Mitochondrial ATPase inhibitor

10664			431422	25	4.4456266254766903e-07	NdhM	Cyanobacterial and plastid NDH-1 subunit M. The proton-pumping NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase catalyzes the electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone linked with proton translocation across the membrane. It is the largest, most complex and least understood of the respiratory chain enzymes and is referred to as Complex I. The subunit composition of the enzyme varies between groups of organisms. Complex I originating from mammalian mitochondria contains 45 different proteins, whereas in bacteria, the corresponding complex NDH-1 consists of 14 different polypeptides. homologs of these 14 proteins are found among subunits of the mitochondrial complex I, and therefore bacterial NDH-1 might be considered a model proton-pumping NADH dehydrogenase with a minimal set of subunits. Escherichia coli NDH-1 readily disintegrates into 3 sub-complexes: a water-soluble NADH dehydrogenase fragment (NuoE, -F, and -G),the connecting fragment (NuoB, -C, -D, and -I), and the membrane fragment (NuoA, -H, -J, -K, -L, -M, -N). In cyanobacteria and their descendants, the chloroplasts of green plants, the subunit composition of NDH-1 remains obscure. The genes for eleven subunits NdhA-NdhK, homologous to the NuoA-NuoD and NuoH-NuoN of the E. coli complex, have been found in the genome of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 which has a family of 6 ndhD genes and a family of 3 ndhF genes. Two reported multisubunit complexes, NDH-1L and NDH-1M, represent distinct NDH-1 complexes in the thylakoid membrane of Synechocystis 6803 -cyanobacterium. NDH-1L was shown to be essential for photoheterotrophic cell growth, whereas expression of NDH-1M was a prerequisite for CO2 uptake and played an important role in growth of cells at low CO2. Here we report the subunit composition of these two complexes. Fifteen proteins were discovered in NDH-1L including NdhL, a new component of the membrane fragment, and Ssl1690 (designated as NdhO), a novel peripheral subunit. The cyanobacterial NDH-1 complex contains additional subunits, NdhM and NdhN, compared with the minimal set of the bacterial enzyme and these seem to be specific for thylakoid-located NDH-1 of photosynthetic organisms. The three subunits of NDH-1, NdhM, NdhN and NdhO are essential for effecting cyclic electron flow around photosystem I, by supplying extra-ATP for photosynthesis in both plastids and cyanobacteria.	107		Cyanobacterial and plastid NDH-1 subunit M	Cyanobacterial and plastid NDH-1 subunit M

Structural and bioinformatic analyses reveal partial similarities to Rossmann-like methyltransferases, with residues from the enolase-like fold combining to form a unique active site that is likely to be involved in the condensation or hydrolysis of molecules implicated in the synthesis of flavins, pterins or other siderophores.

01890			426496	23	4.0899764954385563e-07	CbiG_C	Cobalamin synthesis G C-terminus. Members of this family are involved in cobalamin synthesis. The protein encoded by Synechocystis sp.cbiH represents a fusion between cbiH and cbiG. As other multi-functional proteins involved in cobalamin biosynthesis catalyze adjacent steps in the pathway, including CysG, CobL (CbiET), CobIJ and CobA-HemD, it is therefore possible that CbiG catalyzes a reaction step adjacent to CbiH. In the anaerobic pathway such a step could be the formation of a gamma lactone, which is thought to help to mediate the anaerobic ring contraction process. Within the cobalamin synthesis pathway CbiG catalyzes the both the opening of the lactone ring and the extrusion of the two-carbon fragment of cobalt-precorrin-5A from C-20 and its associated methyl group (deacylation) to give cobalt-precorrin-5B. This family is the C-terminal region, and the mid- and N-termival parts are conserved independently in other families.	120		Cobalamin synthesis G C-terminus	Cobalamin synthesis G C-terminus

This entry includes the catalytic domain of the protein ImmA, which is a metallopeptidase containing an HEXXH zinc-binding motif from peptidase family M78. ImmA is encoded on a conjugative transposon. Conjugating bacteria are able to transfer conjugative transposons that can, for example, confer resistance to antibiotics. The transposon is integrated into the chromosome, but during conjugation excises itself and then moves to the recipient bacterium and re-integrate into its chromosome. Typically a conjugative tranposon encodes only the proteins required for this activity and the proteins that regulate it. During exponential growth, the ICEBs1 transposon of Bacillus subtilis is inactivated by the immunity repressor protein ImmR, which is encoded by the transposon and represses the genes for excision and transfer. Cleavage of ImmR relaxes repression and allows transfer of the transposon. ImmA has been shown to be essential for the cleavage of ImmR.

The expression of YjbE is higher than the rest of the operon yjbEFGH. It appears to be restricted to Enterobacteriaceae. YbjE is one of four gene-products expressed from an operon, yjbEFGH, which is regulated by the Rcs phosphorelay in a RcsA-dependent manner, similar to that of other exopolysaccharide biosynthetic pathways. It is highly possible that the yjbEFGH operon encodes a system involved in EPS secretion since none of the products is predicted to have enzymic activity, the products are all secreted and YbjH and F are predicted to be beta-barrel lipoproteins similar to porins. It may be that the operon products play some role in biofilm formation and/or matrix production.	79		Exopolysaccharide production protein YjbE	Exopolysaccharide production protein YjbE

05241			428389	18	3.2008511703432175e-07	EBP	Emopamil binding protein. Emopamil binding protein (EBP) is as a gene that encodes a non-glycosylated type I integral membrane protein of endoplasmic reticulum and shows high level expression in epithelial tissues. The EBP protein has emopamil binding domains, including the sterol acceptor site and the catalytic centre, which show Delta8-Delta7 sterol isomerase activity. Human sterol isomerase, a homolog of mouse EBP, is suggested not only to play a role in cholesterol biosynthesis, but also to affect lipoprotein internalisation. In humans, mutations of EBP are known to cause the genetic disorder of X-linked dominant chondrodysplasia punctata (CDPX2). This syndrome of humans is lethal in most males, and affected females display asymmetric hyperkeratotic skin and skeletal abnormalities.	112		EXPERA (EXPanded EBP superfamily)	EXPERA (EXPanded EBP superfamily)

In budding yeast, GET proteins directly mediate the insertion of newly synthesized TA proteins into endoplasmic reticulum membranes. Similarly, mammalian BAG6, Ubl4a, and SGTA make up a trimeric complex that binds TA proteins post-translationally and then loads them onto the cytosolic ATPase TRC40, which in turn targets them to the endoplasmic reticulum. Structural studies show that this C-terminal TUGS domain of Ubl4a is essential for BAG6 tethering. Given that BAG6 mediates oligomeric complex formation of Ubl4a, TRC35, and TRC40 (mammalian counterparts of Get5, Get4, and Get3, respectively), the C-terminal TUGS domain might be crucial for supporting BAG6-mediated Ubl4a-TRC35 complex formation in humans as an alternative to the direct Get5-Get4 interaction in yeast.	47	CL0072	Tethering Ubl4a to BAGS domain	Ubiquitin superfamily

This motif in the N-terminal domain serves two purposes: it enhances the activity of the catalytic domain by recognizing part of the mRNA cap structure (i.e. activation motif), and secondly, it directly interacts with the decapping activator Dcp1. Mutation in the (YAG) sequence led to los of activity of activate the decapping complex. Hence the activity of the family members involved in mRNA processing mechanisms depends on YAG activation motif that is 11-13 residues N-terminal of a conserved LPxP Dcp1 interaction motif.	19		Proline-rich nuclear receptor coactivator motif	Proline-rich nuclear receptor coactivator motif

Vac14 is a scaffold for the Fab1 kinase complex, a complex that allows for the dynamic interconversion of PI3P and PI(3,5)P2p (phosphoinositide phosphate (PIP) lipids, that are generated transiently on the cytoplasmic face of selected intracellular membranes). This interconversion is regulated by at least five proteins in yeast: the lipid kinase Fab1p, lipid phosphatase Fig4p, the Fab1p activator Vac7p, the Fab1p inhibitor Atg18p, and Vac14p, a protein required for the activity of both Fab1p and Fig4p. This domain appears to be the one responsible for binding to Fab1. The full length Vac14 in yeasts is likely to be a protein carrying a succession of HEAT repeats, most of which have now degenerated.

17413			340128	16	2.8452010403050824e-07	VirB7	Outer membrane lipoprotein virB7. The type IV secretion systems (T4SSs) are ancestrally related to bacterial conjugation machines and are able to translocate proteins and/or protein-DNA complexes to the extracellular milieu or the host interior, in many cases contributing to the ability of the bacterial pathogen to colonize the host and evade its immune system. In the pathogenic plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens T4SS allows the bacterium to transfer a segment of its tumor inducing (Ti-) plasmid DNA into plant cells causing crown gall tumor disease. Proteins in the virB and virD operons catalyze processing of the T-DNA and its transfer to plants. The VirB proteins assemble a secretion apparatus spanning both bacterial membranes to allow transfer of DNA and protein substrates into plant cells. VirB7 and VirB8, along with VirB6, VirB9 and VirB10, are the core components of the Agrobacterium DNA translocation apparatus. Structural studies with the Escherichia coli plasmid pKM101 VirB homologs showed that three proteins, TraN (VirB7 homolog), TraO (VirB9) and TraF (VirB10), form a hetero-tetradecameric structure with 14-fold symmetry forming an outer membrane channel through which the substrates pass. VirB7 stabilizes VirB9 and in its absence bacteria do not accumulate VirB9 preventing assembly of the secretion machine. Members of the VirB7 family are typically 45-65 residues long, becoming 15-20 residues shorter after removal of the N-terminal signal sequence and covalent attachment to lipid molecules.	35		Outer membrane lipoprotein virB7	Outer membrane lipoprotein virB7
19962			437794	16	2.8452010403050824e-07	EAD9	Effector-associated domain 9. Effector-associated domains (EADs) are predicted to function as adaptor domains mediating protein-protein interactions. The EADs show a characteristic architectural pattern. One copy is always fused, typically to the N- or C-terminus, of a core component of a biological conflict system; examples include VMAP, iSTAND, or GAP1. Further copies of the same EAD are fused to either effector or signal-transducing domains, or additional EADs. EAD pairs are frequently observed together on the genome in conserved gene neighborhoods, but can also be severed from such neighborhoods and located in distant regions, indicating EAD-EAD protein domain coupling attenuates collinear transcription requirements.	62		Effector-associated domain 9	Effector-associated domain 9

TetR family regulators are involved in the transcriptional control of multidrug efflux pumps, pathways for the biosynthesis of antibiotics, response to osmotic stress and toxic chemicals, control of catabolic pathways, differentiation processes, and pathogenicity. The TetR proteins identified in overm ultiple genera of bacteria and archaea share a common helix-turn-helix (HTH) structure in their DNA-binding domain. However, TetR proteins can work in different ways: they can bind a target operator directly to exert their effect (e.g. TetR binds Tet(A) gene to repress it in the absence of tetracycline), or they can be involved in complex regulatory cascades in which the TetR protein can either be modulated by another regulator or TetR can trigger the cellular response. TetR regulates the expression of the membrane-associated tetracycline resistance protein, TetA, which exports the tetracycline antibiotic out of the cell before it can attach to the ribosomes and inhibit protein synthesis. TetR blocks transcription from the genes encoding both TetA and TetR in the absence of antibiotic.

This group of families is one of several protein families that are always found associated with prokaryotic CRISPRs, themselves a family of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, DNA repeats found in nearly half of all bacterial and archaeal genomes. These DNA repeat regions have a remarkably regular structure: unique sequences of constant size, called spacers, sit between each pair of repeats. It has been shown that the CRISPRs are virus-derived sequences acquired by the host to enable them to resist viral infection. The Cas proteins from the host use the CRISPRs to mediate an antiviral response. After transcription of the CRISPR, a complex of Cas proteins termed Cascade cleaves a CRISPR RNA precursor in each repeat and retains the cleavage products containing the virus-derived sequence. Assisted by the helicase Cas3, these mature CRISPR RNAs then serve as small guide RNAs that enable Cascade to interfere with virus proliferation. Cas5 contains an endonuclease motif, whose inactivation leads to loss of resistance, even in the presence of phage-derived spacers.	108	CL0362	CRISPR associated protein Cas6, C-terminal	CRISPR-associated (Cas) Repair Associated Mysterious Proteins

However, the cis-regulatory yjdF motif, just upstream from the gene encoding the proteins for this family, is a small non-coding RNA, Rfam:RF01764. The yjdF motif is found in many Firmicutes, including Bacillus subtilis. In most cases, it resides in potential 5' UTRs of homologs of the yjdF gene whose function is unknown. However, in Streptococcus thermophilus, a yjdF RNA motif is associated with an operon whose protein products synthesize nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). Also, the S. thermophilus yjdF RNA lacks typical yjdF motif consensus features downstream of and including the P4 stem. Thus, if yjdF RNAs are riboswitch aptamers, the S. thermophilus RNAs might sense a distinct compound that structurally resembles the ligand bound by other yjdF RNAs. On the ohter hand, perhaps these RNAs have an alternative solution forming a similar binding site, as is observed with some SAM riboswitches.	132		Protein of unknown function (DUF2992)	Domain of unknown function

This is one of two Tudor-like domains found in the N-terminal region of RapA proteins. RapA is an abundant RNAP-associated protein of 110-kDa molecular weight with ATPase activity. It forms a stable complex with the RNAP core enzyme, but not with the holoenzyme. The ATPase activity of RapA increases upon its binding to RNAP. The N-terminal region of RapA contains two copies of a Tudor-like domains, both folded as a highly bent antiparallel beta-sheet. This fold is also found in transcription factor NusG, ribosomal protein L24, human SMN (survival of motor neuron) protein, mammalian DNA repair factor 53BP1, putative fission yeast DNA repair factor Crb2 and bacterial transcription-repair coupling factor known as Mfd. The functional roles of the N-terminal region homologs in these proteins suggest that the Tudor-like domains of RapA may interact with both nucleic acids and RNAP.	62	CL0049	RapA N-terminal Tudor like domain	Tudor domain 'Royal family'

This family was thought originally to be involved in cell-adhesion, but the members are now known to be proteasome subunit Rpn13, a novel ubiquitin receptor. The 26S proteasome is a huge macromolecular protein-degradation machine consisting of a proteolytically active 20S core, in the form of four disc-like proteins, and one or two 19S regulatory particles. The regulatory particle(s) sit on the top and or bottom of the core, de-ubiquitinate the substrate peptides, unfold them and guide them into the narrow channel through the centre of the core. Rpn13 and its homologs dock onto the regulatory particle through the N-terminal region which binds Rpn2. The C-terminal part of the domain binds de-ubiquitinating enzyme Uch37/UCHL5 and enhances its isopeptidase activity. Rpn13 binds ubiquitin via a conserved amino-terminal region called the pleckstrin-like receptor for ubiquitin, termed Pru, domain. The domain forms two contiguous anti-parallel beta-sheets with a configuration similar to the pleckstrin-homology domain (PHD) fold. Rpn13's ability to bind ubiquitin and the proteasome subunit Rpn2/S1 simultaneously supports evidence of its role as a ubiquitin receptor. Finally, when complexed to di-ubiquitin, via the Pru, and Uch37 via the C-terminal part, it frees up the distal ubiquitin for de-ubiquitination by the Uch37.	87	CL0266	Proteasome complex subunit Rpn13 ubiquitin receptor	PH domain-like superfamily

17427			340142	13	2.3117258452478795e-07	Phi29_Phage_SSB	Phage Single-stranded DNA-binding protein. DNA replication of phi29 and related phages takes place via a strand displacement mechanism, a process that generates large amounts of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Consequently, phage-encoded ssDNA-binding proteins (SSBs) are essential proteins during phage phi29-like DNA replication. Single-stranded DNA-binding proteins (SSBs) destabilize double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and bind without sequence specificity, but selectively and cooperatively, to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) conferring a regular structure to it, which is recognized and exploited by a variety of enzymes involved in DNA replication, repair and recombination. Phage phi29 protein p5 is the SSB protein active during phi29 DNA replication. It protects ssDNA against nuclease degradation and greatly stimulates dNTP incorporation during phi29 DNA replication process. Binding of the SSB to ssDNA prevents non-productive binding of the viral DNA polymerase to ssDNA, and allows the release DNA polymerase molecules that are already titrated by the ssDNA. This effect would be of particular importance in phi29-like DNA replication systems, where large amounts of ssDNA are generated and SSB binding to ssDNA could favor efficient re-usage of templates. This domain family is found in SSB proteins in phage phi-29, homologs are found in pfam00436.	123		Phage Single-stranded DNA-binding protein	Phage Single-stranded DNA-binding protein

17524			407527	12	2.1339007802288122e-07	CnrY	anti-sigma factor CnrY. This family is found in alpha and beta proteobacteria. Family members include anti-sigma factor CnrY from Cupriavidus metallidurans. Sigma factors are multi-domain sub-units of bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) that play critical roles in transcription initiation, including the recognition and opening of promoters as well as the initial steps in RNA synthesis. They also control a wide variety of adaptive responses such as morphological development and the management of stress. A recurring theme in sigma factor control is their sequestration by anti-sigma factors that occlude their RNAP-binding determinants. CnrH, controls cobalt and nickel resistance in Cupriavidus metallidurans. CnrH is regulated by a complex of two transmembrane proteins: the periplasmic sensor CnrX and the anti-sigma CnrY. At rest, CnrH is sequestered by CnrY whose 45-residue-long cytosolic domain is one of the shortest anti-sigma domains. Upon Ni(II) or Co(II) ions detection by CnrX in the periplasm, CnrH is released between CnrH and the cytosolic domain of CnrY (CnrYc). The CnrH/CnrYC complex displays an unexpected structural similarity to the anti-sigma NepR in complex with its antagonist PhyR, whereas NepR shares no sequence similarity with CnrY. Crystal structure of CnrH/CnrY shows that CnrYC residues 3-19 are folded as a well-defined alpha-helix. The peptide further extends along the hydrophobic groove of sigma 2 with no canonical structure except for a short helical turn spanning residues 24-28. CnrY has a hydrophobic knob made of V4, W7 and L8 side chains protruding into sigma 4 hydrophobic pocket and contributing to the interface. In vivo investigation of CnrY function pinpoints part of the hydrophobic knob as a hotspot in CnrH inhibitory binding.	98		Anti-sigma factor CnrY	Anti-sigma factor CnrY

Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) are regulated by the eight-subunit COP9 signalosome (CSN). Enzymatically, CSN functions as an isopeptidase that removes the ubiquitin-like activator NEDD8 from CRLs, but it can also bind deneddylated CRLs and maintain them in an inactive state. The CSN subunits CSN1, CSN2, CSN3, CSN4, CSN7 and CSN8, share a common domain composition: an N-terminal array of tandem alpha-helical tetratricopeptide/-like repeats, a 34 residue motif, followed by a PCI domain, which encompasses a WH subdomain, a linker, and one or two alpha-helices at the C-terminus. This entry describes the C-terminal helices found on CSN4. The two helices from CSN4 (helices I and II) form a brace roughly perpendicular to the bundle axis in contact with the three C-terminal helices of CSN6. CSN5, whose two C-terminal helices form an antiparallel hairpin, inserts its final C-terminal helix (helix II) into the central CSN6 framework at the core of the bundle. Both CSN1 and CSN4 are dependent on the presence of their C-terminal helix (CSN1 isoform-2 residues: 466-527; and CSN4: 364-406) for integration into CSN. COP9 signalosome shares common architecture with the 26S proteasome lid and eIF3 where the 19S lid subunit RPN5 and the eIF3 core subunit eIF3a share significant structural similarity with CSN4.	42	CL0123	CSN4/RPN5/eIF3a helix turn helix domain	Helix-turn-helix clan

01298	MBB	Outer membrane beta-barrel protein superfamily	426188	10	1.7782506501906765e-07	TbpB_B_D	C-lobe and N-lobe beta barrels of Tf-binding protein B. Bacterial lipoproteins represent a large group of specialized membrane proteins that perform a variety of functions including maintenance and stabilization of the cell envelope, protein targeting and transit to the outer membrane, membrane biogenesis, and cell adherence. Pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria within the Neisseriaceae and Pasteurellaceae families rely on a specialized uptake system, characterized by an essential surface receptor complex that acquires iron from host transferrin (Tf) and transports the iron across the outer membrane. They have an iron uptake system composed of surface exposed lipoprotein, Tf-binding protein B (TbpB), and an integral outer-membrane protein, Tf-binding protein A (TbpA), that together function to extract iron from the host iron binding glycoprotein (Tf). TbpB is a bilobed (N and C lobe) lipid-anchored protein with each lobe consisting of an eight-stranded beta barrel flanked by a handle domain made up of four (N lobe) or eight (C lobe) beta strands. TbpB extends from the outer membrane surface by virtue of an N-terminal peptide region that is anchored to the outer membrane by fatty acyl chains on the N-terminal cysteine and is involved in the initial capture of iron-loaded Tf. This domain family is found in C and N lobe eight stranded beta barrel region of TbpB proteins. The eight-stranded barrel domains in N and C lobe draw comparisons to eight-stranded beta barrel outer-membrane protein W (OmpW). However, the barrel domains of TbpB have the hydrophobic residues line the inner surface of the beta barrels to create a stable hydrophobic core.	126	CL0193	C-lobe and N-lobe beta barrels of Tf-binding protein B	Outer membrane beta-barrel protein superfamily

18616			436623	10	1.7782506501906765e-07	CdiI_3	CDI immunity proteins. Contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI) is a widespread mechanism of bacterial competition. CDI+ bacteria deliver the toxic C-terminal region of contact-dependent inhibition A proteins (CdiA-CT) into neighboring target bacteria and produce CDI immunity proteins (CdiI) which bind CdiA-CT domains and neutralize their toxic activity to protect against self-inhibition. CdiI immunity proteins are also variable and only neutralize their cognate CdiA-CT toxins. Structure analysis of CdiI from Escherichia coli 536 (EC536) shows that is composed of a single domain and that it blocks the interaction with substrate, strongly suggesting that the immunity protein occludes the nuclease active site.	94		CDI immunity proteins	CDI immunity proteins

This family represents the N terminal region of the enzyme arginine-tRNA-protein transferase (EC 2.3.2.8), which catalyzes the post-translational conjugation of arginine to the N-terminus of a protein. In eukaryotes, this functions as part of the N-end rule pathway of protein degradation by conjugating a de-stabilizing amino acid to the amino terminal aspartate or glutamate of a protein, targeting the protein for ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. N terminal cysteine is sometimes modified. In S cerevisiae, Cys20, 23, 94 and/or 95 are thought to be important for activity. Of these, only Cys 94 appears to be completely conserved in this family.	71	CL0257	Arginine-tRNA-protein transferase, N terminus	N-acetyltransferase like

08573			430084	10	1.7782506501906765e-07	SAE2	DNA repair protein endonuclease SAE2/CtIP C-terminus. SAE2 is a protein involved in repairing meiotic and mitotic double-strand breaks in DNA. It has been shown to negatively regulate DNA damage checkpoint signalling. SAE2 is homologous to the CtIP proteins in mammals and an homologous protein in plants. Crucial sequence motifs that are highly conserved are the CxxC and the RHR motifs in this C-terminal part of the protein. It is now known to be an endonuclease. In budding yeast, genetic evidence suggests that the SAE2 protein is essential for the processing of hairpin DNA intermediates and meiotic double-strand breaks by Mre11/Rad50 complexes. SAE2 binds DNA and exhibits endonuclease activity on single-stranded DNA independently of Mre11/Rad50 complexes, but hairpin DNA structures are cleaved cooperatively in the presence of Mre11/Rad50 or Mre11/Rad50/Xrs2. Hairpin structures are not processed at the tip by SAE2 but rather at single-stranded DNA regions adjacent to the hairpin. The catalytic activities of SAE2 are important for its biological functions.	110		DNA endonuclease activator SAE2/CtIP C-terminus	DNA endonuclease activator SAE2/CtIP C-terminus

TetR family regulators are involved in the transcriptional control of multidrug efflux pumps, pathways for the biosynthesis of antibiotics, response to osmotic stress and toxic chemicals, control of catabolic pathways, differentiation processes, and pathogenicity. The TetR proteins identified in overm ultiple genera of bacteria and archaea share a common helix-turn-helix (HTH) structure in their DNA-binding domain. However, TetR proteins can work in different ways: they can bind a target operator directly to exert their effect (e.g. TetR binds Tet(A) gene to repress it in the absence of tetracycline), or they can be involved in complex regulatory cascades in which the TetR protein can either be modulated by another regulator or TetR can trigger the cellular response. This entry represents the C-terminal domain present in Yfir transcription regulator proteins found in Bacillus subtilus. TetR regulates the expression of the membrane-associated tetracycline resistance protein, TetA, which exports the tetracycline antibiotic out of the cell before it can attach to the ribosomes and inhibit protein synthesis. TetR blocks transcription from the genes encoding both TetA and TetR in the absence of antibiotic. The C-terminal domain is multi-helical and is interlocked in the homodimer with the helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding domain.	100	CL0174	Tetracyclin repressor-like, C-terminal domain	TetR protein, C-terminal domain-like

Proteins in this family are typically between 136 to 150 amino acids in length. The opportunistic pathogen Mycobacterium smegmatis is resistant to rifampin because of the presence of a chromosomally encoded rifampin ADP-ribosyltransferase (Arr-ms). Arr-ms is a small enzyme whose activity thus renders rifamycin antibiotics ineffective.	99	CL0084	Rifampin ADP-ribosyl transferase	ADP-ribosylation Superfamily

The BBSome (so-named after the association with Bardet-Biedl syndrome) is a complex of 8 subunits that lies at the base of the flagellar microtubule structure. The precise function of all the individual components in cilia formation is unclear, however they function to promote loading of cargo to the ciliary axoneme. The primary cilium, a slim microtubule-based organelle that projects from the surface of vertebrate cells has crucial roles in vertebrate development and human genetic diseases. Cilia are required for the response to developmental signals, and evidence is accumulating that the primary cilium is specialized for Hedgehog (Hh) signal transduction. Formation of cilia, in turn, is regulated by other signalling pathways, possibly including the planar cell polarity pathway. The connections between cilia and developmental signalling have begun to clarify the basis of human diseases associated with ciliary dysfunction. BBS2 is one of the three Bardet-Biedl syndrome subunits that is required for leptin receptor signalling in the hypothalamus, and BBS2 and 4 are also required for the localization of somatostatin receptor 3 and melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 into neuronal cilia.	108	CL0186	Ciliary BBSome complex subunit 2, middle region	Beta propeller clan

Some rhamnosides are important bioactive compounds. For example, terpenyl glycosides, the glycosidic precursor of aromatic terpenoids, act as important flavouring substances in grapes. Other rhamnosides act as cytotoxic rhamnosylated terpenoids, as signal substances in plants or play a role in the antigenicity of pathogenic bacteria.	102	CL0004	Bacterial alpha-L-rhamnosidase concanavalin-like domain	Concanavalin-like lectin/glucanase superfamily
12998			432930	9	1.6004255851716087e-07	ING	Inhibitor of growth proteins N-terminal histone-binding. Histones undergo numerous post-translational modifications, including acetylation and methylation, at residues which are then probable docking sites for various chromatin remodelling complexes. Inhibitor of growth proteins (INGs) specifically bind to residues that have been thus modified. INGs carry a well-characterized C-terminal PHD-type zinc-finger domain, binding with lysine 4-tri-methylated histone H3 (H3K4me3), as well as this N-terminal domain that binds unmodified H3 tails. Although these two regions can bind histones independently, together they increase the apparent association of the ING for the H3 tail.	100		Inhibitor of growth proteins N-terminal histone-binding	Inhibitor of growth proteins N-terminal histone-binding

The animal pepsin-like endopeptidase propeptides form a distinct family of propeptides, which contain a conserved motif approximately 30 residues long. In pepsinogen A, the first 11 residues of the mature pepsin sequence are displaced by residues of the propeptide. The propeptide contains two helices that block the active site cleft, in particular the conserved Asp11 residue, in pepsin, hydrogen bonds to a conserved Arg residues in the propeptide. This hydrogen bond stabilizes the propeptide conformation and is probably responsible for triggering the conversion of pepsinogen to pepsin under acidic conditions.	29		A1 Propeptide	A1 Propeptide

This domain can be found in the N-terminus of the FusB, FusC, and FusD proteins from Staphylococcus aureus. They are elongation factor G (EF-G) binding proteins that are linked to the fusidic acid (FA) resistance in S. aureus. The FusB proteins are two-domain metalloproteins, and this N-terminal domain forms a four-helical bundle whose helices help to stabilize the conformation of the treble-clef zinc-finger in the C-terminal domain. FA is an antibiotic that binds to EF-G, preventing its release from the ribosome, thus stalling bacterial protein synthesis. The FusB proteins provide FA resistance by preventing formation or facilitating dissociation of the FA-locked EF-G-ribosome complex during elongation and ribosome recycling.	82		Elongation factor G-binding protein, N-terminal	Elongation factor G-binding protein

10598			431384	8	1.4226005201525412e-07	RRM_4	RNA recognition motif of the spliceosomal PrP8. The large RNA-protein complex of the spliceosome catalyzes pre-mRNA splicing. One of the most conserved core proteins is PrP8 which occupies a central position in the catalytic core of the spliceosome, and has been implicated in several crucial molecular rearrangements that occur there, and has recently come under the spotlight for its role in the inherited human disease, Retinitis Pigmentosa. The RNA-recognition motif of PrP8 is highly conserved and provides a possible RNA binding centre for the 5-prime SS, BP, or 3-prime SS of pre-mRNA which are known to contact with Prp8. The most conserved regions of an RRM are defined as the RNP1 and RNP2 sequences. Recognition of RNA targets can also be modulated by a number of other factors, most notably the two loops beta1-alpha1, beta2-beta3 and the amino acid residues C-terminal to the RNP2 domain.	92		RNA recognition motif of the spliceosomal PrP8	RNA recognition motif of the spliceosomal PrP8

This domain is found in eukaryotes. This domain is about 150 amino acids in length. This eukaryotic domain is found associated with pfam00595. It has a conserved GILD sequence motif. Family members have been found to be essential for cell polarity establishment and maintenance such as Par3 (partitioning defective) and involved in conversion of histidine into ammonia (a crucial step for forming histamine in humans) such as Histidine ammonia lyase (HAL). This N-terminal domain is found to mediate oligomerization critical for the membrane localization of Par-3. It is also found to possess a self-association capacity via a front-to-back mode in Par-3 and HAL proteins. However, unlike the Par-3 N-terminal domain which self-assembles into a left-handed helical filament, the HAL N-terminal domain does not tend to form a helical filament but rather self-assembles into circular oligomeric particles. This has been suggested to be likely due to the absence of equivalent charged residues that are essential for the longitudinal packing of the Par-3 N-terminal domain filament.	82	CL0072	N-terminal of Par3 and HAL proteins	Ubiquitin superfamily

MqsA_antitoxin is a family of prokaryotic proteins that act as antidotes to the mRNA interferase MqsR. It has a zinc-binding at the very N-terminus indicating its DNA-binding capacity. MqsR is the gene most highly upregulated in E. Colo MqsR_toxin is a family of bacterial toxins that act as an mRNA interferase. MqsR is the gene most highly upregulated in E. coli persister cells and it plays an essential role in biofilm regulation and cell signalling. It forms part of a bacterial toxin-antitoxin TA system, and as expected for a TA system, the expression of the MqsR toxin leads to growth arrest, while co-expression with its antitoxin, MqsA, rescues the growth arrest phenotype. In addition, MqsR associates with MqsA to form a tight, non-toxic complex and both MqsA alone and the MqsR:MqsA2:MqsR complex bind and regulate the mqsR promoter. The structure of MqsR shows that is is a member of the RelE/YoeB family of bacterial RNases that are structurally and functionally characterized bacterial toxins.	131	CL0123	Antitoxin component of bacterial toxin-antitoxin system, MqsA	Helix-turn-helix clan

This observation correlates with the functional information available on two GGDEF-containing proteins, namely diguanylate cyclase and phosphodiesterase A of Acetobacter xylinum, both of which regulate the turnover of cyclic diguanosine monophosphate. In the WspR protein of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the GGDEF domain acts as a diguanylate cyclase, Structure 3bre, when the whole molecule appears to form a tetramer consisting of two symmetrically-related dimers representing a biological unit. The active site is the GGD/EF motif, buried in the structure, and the cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) bind to the inhibitory-motif RxxD on the surface. The enzyme thus catalyzes the cyclisation of two guanosine triphosphate (GTP) molecules to one c-di-GMP molecule.	160	CL0276	Diguanylate cyclase, GGDEF domain	Nucleotide cyclase superfamily

Glutathione biosynthesis is achieved in most organisms via a conserved two-step approach relying on the capacity of two independent and unrelated ligases to perform peptide synthesis coupled to ATP hydrolysis. In a first and rate-limiting step, gamma-glutamylcysteine ligase (gamma-ECL) (or GshA; EC:6.3.2.2) uses l-glutamate and l-cysteine to form gamma-glutamylcysteine (gamma-EC), which, in a second step, is condensed with glycine to glutathione by glutathione synthetase (GS) (or GshB; EC:6.3.2.3). However, several pathogenic and free-living bacteria carry out glutathione biosynthesis based on a single enzyme that catalyzes both the gamma-ECL and the GS reactions. Such bifunctional glutathione-synthesizing enzymes have been termed gamma-GCS-GS or GshF. Hybrid GshF contains a typical gamma-proteobacterial gamma-ECL fused to an ATP-grasp-like domain. The ATP-grasp-like module is responsible for the ensuing formation of glutathione from gamma-glutamylcysteine and glycine. The ATP-grasp-like domain has an antiparallel beta-sheet in the GshF structures in contrast to all structurally characterized members of the ATP-grasp superfamily.	54	CL0179	ATP-grasp-like domain	ATP-grasp superfamily

The L27_2 domain is a protein-protein interaction domain capable of organising scaffold proteins into supramolecular assemblies by formation of heteromeric L27_2 domain complexes. L27_2 domain-mediated protein assemblies have been shown to play essential roles in cellular processes including asymmetric cell division, establishment and maintenance of cell polarity, and clustering of receptors and ion channels. Members of this family form specific heterotetrameric complexes, in which each domain contains three alpha-helices. The two N-terminal helices of each L27_2 domain pack together to form a tight, four-helix bundle in the heterodimer, whilst the third helix of each L27_2 domain forms another four-helix bundle that assembles the two units of the heterodimer into a tetramer.	58	CL0614	L27_2	L27 domain superfamily

04386			427913	7	1.2447754551334734e-07	SspB	Stringent starvation protein B. Escherichia coli stringent starvation protein B (SspB), is thought to enhance the specificity of degradation of tmRNA-tagged proteins by the ClpXP protease. The tmRNA tag, also known as ssrA, is an 11-aa peptide added to the C-terminus of proteins stalled during translation, targets proteins for degradation by ClpXP and ClpAP. SspB a cytoplasmic protein that specifically binds to residues 1-4 and 7 of the tag. Binding of SspB enhances degradation of tagged proteins by ClpX, and masks sequence elements important for ClpA interactions, inhibiting degradation by ClpA. However, more recent work has cast doubt on the importance of SspB in wild-type cells. SspB is encoded in an operon whose synthesis is stimulated by carbon, amino acid, and phosphate starvation. SspB may play a special role during nutrient stress, for example by ensuring rapid degradation of the products of stalled translation, without causing a global increase in degradation of all ClpXP substrates.	144		Stringent starvation protein B	Stringent starvation protein B

12862	TPR	Tetratrico peptide repeat superfamily	432838	6	1.0669503901144061e-07	ANAPC5	Anaphase-promoting complex subunit 5. Apc5 is a subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) which is a multi-subunit ubiquitin ligase that mediates the proteolysis of cell cycle proteins in mitosis and G1. Apc5, although it does not harbour a classical RNA binding domain, Apc5 binds the poly(A) binding protein (PABP), which directly binds the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of growth factor 2 mRNA. PABP was found to enhance IRES-mediated translation, whereas Apc5 over-expression counteracted this effect. In addition to its association with the APC/C complex, Apc5 binds much heavier complexes and co-sediments with the ribosomal fraction. The N-terminus of Afi1 serves to stabilize the union between Apc4 and Apc5, both of which lie towards the bottom-front of the APC.

15018			434395	6	1.0669503901144061e-07	InaF-motif	TRP-interacting helix. This highly conserved motif is thought to be a transmembrane helix that binds to transient receptor potential (TRP) calcium channel. It is known that proline-rich proteins inactivate tannins found in food compounds, and it is putatively thought that PRR24 does too. This is important since tannins often inhibit the uptake of iron. InaF is a protein required for TRP calcium channel function in Drosophila. TRP-related channels have been suggested to mediate store-operated calcium entry, important for Ca2+ homeostasis in a wide variety of cell types. The amino acid sequence of PRR-24 contains two completely conserved Y residues that may be functionally important.

17975			436185	6	1.0669503901144061e-07	RNR_Alpha	Ribonucleotide reductase alpha domain. This is the alpha helical domain of ribonucleotide reductases. Family members include Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR, EC:1.17.4.1) which catalyse the reductive synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides from their corresponding ribonucleotides. It provides the precursors necessary for DNA synthesis. RNRs divide into three classes on the basis of their metallocofactor usage. This domain is found in Class II. Class II RNRs, found in bacteria, bacteriophage, algae and archaea, use coenzyme B12 (adenosylcobalamin, AdoCbl). Many organisms have more than one class of RNR present in their genomes. Ribonucleotide reductase is an oligomeric enzyme composed of a large sub-unit (700 to 1000 residues) and a small sub-unit (300 to 400 residues) - class II RNRs are less complex, using the small molecule B12 in place of the small chain. Some family members carry ATP cone domain which acts as a functional regulator. Competitive binding of ATP and dATP to an N-terminal ATP-cone domain determines enzyme activity. As the ratio of dATP to ATP increases above a certain threshold, the enzyme activity is turned off. Substrate nucleotides are recognized by relatively simple H-bonding interactions at the N-terminus of one or more alpha helices. In the monomeric class II RNR, the effector binds in a pocket formed by helices in a 130 amino acid insertion which constitutes this domain.	101		Ribonucleotide reductase alpha domain	Ribonucleotide reductase alpha domain

TetR family regulators are involved in the transcriptional control of multidrug efflux pumps, pathways for the biosynthesis of antibiotics, response to osmotic stress and toxic chemicals, control of catabolic pathways, differentiation processes, and pathogenicity. The TetR proteins identified in overm ultiple genera of bacteria and archaea share a common helix-turn-helix (HTH) structure in their DNA-binding domain. However, TetR proteins can work in different ways: they can bind a target operator directly to exert their effect (e.g. TetR binds Tet(A) gene to repress it in the absence of tetracycline), or they can be involved in complex regulatory cascades in which the TetR protein can either be modulated by another regulator or TetR can trigger the cellular response. TetR regulates the expression of the membrane-associated tetracycline resistance protein, TetA, which exports the tetracycline antibiotic out of the cell before it can attach to the ribosomes and inhibit protein synthesis. TetR blocks transcription from the genes encoding both TetA and TetR in the absence of antibiotic.

E coli and Salmonella spp, that mediate interactions important for host and environmental persistence, development of biofilms, motility, colonisation and invasion of cells, and conjugation. Four general assembly pathways for different fimbriae have been proposed, one of which is extracellular nucleation-precipitation (ENP), that differs from the others in that fibre-growth occurs extracellularly. Thin aggregative fimbriae (Tafi) are the only fimbriae dependent on the ENP pathway. Tafi were first identified in Salmonella spp and the controlling operon termed agf; however subsequent isolation of the homologous operon in E coli led to its being called csg. Tafi are known as curli because, in the absence of extracellular polysaccharides, their morphology appears curled; however, when expressed with such polysaccharides their morphology appears as a tangled amorphous matrix. The gene agfC is found to be transcribed at low levels, localized to the periplasm in a mature form, and in combination with AgfE is important for AgfA extracellular assembly, which facilitates the synthesis of Tafi. The genes involved in Tafi production are organized into two adjacent divergently transcribed operons, agfBAC and agfDEFG, both of which are required for biosynthesis and assembly.	98	CL0159	Thin aggregative fimbriae synthesis protein	Ig-like fold superfamily (E-set)

11250			431758	5	8.891253250953383e-08	FAF	Fantastic Four meristem regulator. FAF is a family of plant proteins that regulate the size of the shoot meristem by modulating the CLV3-WUS feedback loop. The proteins are expressed in the centre of the shoot meristem, overlapping with the site of WUS - the homeodomain transcription factor WUSCHEL- expression. FAF proteins are capable of modulating shoot growth by repressing WUS in the organising centre of the shoot meristem. The ability of plants to form new organs throughout their life cycle requires tight control of the meristems to avoid unregulated growth. Plants have evolved an elaborate genetic network that controls meristem size and maintenance. WUS and the CLAVATA (CLV) ligand-receptor system are at the core of the network that regulates the size of the stem cell population in the shoot meristem.	56		Fantastic Four meristem regulator	Fantastic Four meristem regulator

Several adaptor proteins have been reported to interact specifically with the CBD, thus defining the specific subcellular functions of myosin VI. The crystal structure determination of the myosin VI CBD/Dab2 (an endocytic adaptor protein Disabled-2 that is a cargo) complex shows that the Myosin-VI_CBD forms a cargo-induced dimer, suggesting that the motor undergoes monomer-to-dimer conversion that is dependent upon cargo binding. In the absence of cargo myosin VI exists as a stable monomer. This cargo binding-mediated monomer-to-dimer conversion mechanism adopted by myosin VI may be shared by other unconventional myosins, such as myosin VII and myosin X.	90		Myosin VI cargo binding domain	Myosin VI cargo binding domain

18085			436260	5	8.891253250953383e-08	Mak_N_cap	Maltokinase N-terminal cap domain. Glycogen is a central energy storage molecule in bacteria and the metabolic pathways associated with its biosynthesis and degradation are crucial for maintaining cellular energy homeostasis. In mycobacteria, the GlgE pathway involves the combined action of trehalose synthase (TreS), maltokinase (Mak) and maltosyltransferase (GlgE). The N-terminal lobe can be divided into two subdomains: a cap N-terminal subdomain comprising the first 88 amino acid residues. This entry is for the cap N-terminal domain found in mycobacterial maltokinase (Mak), (EC:2.7.1.175). The N-terminal cap subdomain and the C-terminal lobe are predominantly acidic, the intermediate subdomain is enriched in positively charged residues. A structural search with only the first 88 amino acid residues of Mak, corresponding to the N-terminal cap subdomain of maltokinases, unveiled a resemblance with proteins displaying the cystatin fold and a remote similarity with the N-terminal domain of the serine/threonine protein kinase GCN2. Conservation of the cap subdomain in maltokinases (including the bifunctional TreS-Mak enzymes), in particular of the residues in the proximity of the P-loop, together with the potential flexibility of this region, are compatible with regulatory functions for this subdomain. Hence it is hypothesized that the N-terminal cap subdomain plays a central role in modulation of Mak enzymatic activity.	88		Maltokinase N-terminal cap domain	Maltokinase N-terminal cap domain

However Hemerythrin is classically described as Oxygen-binding through two attached Fe2+ ions. And the bacterial NorA is a regulator of response to NO, which suggests yet another set-up for its metal ligands. In Staphylococcus aureus the iron-sulfur cluster repair protein ScdA has been noted to be important when the organism switches to living in environments with low oxygen concentrations; perhaps this protein acts as an oxygen store or scavenger.	128		Hemerythrin HHE cation binding domain	Hemerythrin HHE cation binding domain

This family is a fused Ig and PH domain found on plant-specific actin-binding proteins or SCABs. SCAB proteins bind, bundle and stabilize actin filaments and regulate stomatal movement. The Ig-PH fusion domain is at the C-terminus. This domain has the N-terminal Ig beta-sandwich fold consisting of two antiparallel beta-sheets built from strands beta1 and beta2 and strands beta3-beta6, respectively. The C-terminus of the fused domains adopts the PH fold, of seven beta-strands, beta7-beta13 and two alpha-helices, alpha1 and alpha2 arranged into a beta-barrel. The Ig and PH domains appear to be truly fused together into an integral structure which displays a few conserved patches on the surface, particularly of the PH part. The canonical phosphoinositide-binding pocket of the classic PH domain is degenerate in this fused one, and the charge on the pocket suggest that the Ig-PH domain contains a non-canonical binding site for inositol phosphates. There are a handful of bacterial members at low threshold but they are missing the PH part of the fused domain, and appear to match little else.	98	CL0159	Ig domain of plant-specific actin-binding protein	Ig-like fold superfamily (E-set)

The locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) is essential for virulence of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC). It encodes some 20 genes including an overall regulator ler and two others, GrlR and GrlA, that form the type three secretion system for infection.

09158			286268	4	7.113002600762706e-08	MotCF	Bacteriophage T4 MotA, C-terminal. Members of this family adopt a compact alpha/beta structure comprising three alpha-helices and six beta-strands in the order: alpha1-beta1-beta2-beta3-beta4-alpha2-beta5-beta6-alpha3. The beta-strands form a single anti-parallel beta-sheet and the three alpha-helices pack side-by-side onto one surface of the beta-sheet. In this architecture, the domain's hydrophobic core is at the sheet-helix interface, and the second surface of the beta-sheet is completely exposed. The domain is a DNA-binding motif, with a consensus sequence containing nine base pairs (5'-TTTGCTTTA-3'), that appears to bind to various mot boxes, allowing access to the minor groove towards the 5'-end of this sequence and the major groove towards the 3'-end.	103		Bacteriophage T4 MotA, C-terminal	Bacteriophage T4 MotA

The SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5-Acetyltransferase) transcriptional co-activator is a protein complex that regulates inducible yeast genes by performing multiple functions including acetylating core histones, recruiting the RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex, and deubiquitinating histone H2B. The deubiquitinating activity of SAGA resides in a distinct sub-complex called the deubiquitinating module (DUBm), which consists of four proteins that are conserved across eukaryotes: Ubp8, Sgf11, Sus1 and Sgf73. The DUBm proteins are organized into two lobes around the globular domains of Ubp8. In SAGA, Sus1 binds to Sgf11 by wrapping around this N-terminal domain of Sgf11, forming a stable dimer.	39		SAGA-associated factor 11 N-terminal domain	SAGA-associated factor 11 N-terminal domain

This family contains bacterial and phage tail fibre assembly proteins. E.coli contains several members of this family although the function of these proteins is uncertain. Using the lambda phage members as examples, there are both gptfa and gpK tail proteins here. GpK forms part of the TTC or tail-tip complex that is located at the distal end of the tail. TTCs form the platform on which the tail-tube proteins self-assemble and are also the attachment point for fibers or receptor-binding proteins that mediate phage-adsorption to the surface of the host cell. TTC assembly starts with gpJ, which is also known as the central tail fibre and is involved in host-cell adsorption. It is the C-terminus of gpJ that interacts with the lamB receptor on host cells. A number of intermediates including gpK then interact with gpJ during tail morphogenesis.	130	CL0348	Caudovirales tail fibre assembly protein, lambda gpK	Phage virion morphogenesis superfamily

14931			434325	4	7.113002600762706e-08	IFT20	Intraflagellar transport complex B, subunit 20. IFT20 is subunit 20 of the intraflagellar transport complex B. The intraflagellar transport complex assembles and maintains eukaryotic cilia and flagella. IFT20 is localized to the Golgi complex and is anchored there by the Golgi polypeptide, GMAP210, whereas all other subunits except IFT172 localize to cilia and the peri-basal body or centrosomal region at the base of cilia. IFT20 accompanies Golgi-derived vesicles to the point of exocytosis near the basal bodies where the other IFT polypeptides are present, and where the intact IFT particle is assembled in association with the inner surface of the cell membrane. Passage of the IFT complex then follows, through the flagellar pore recognition site at the transition region, into the ciliary compartment. There also appears to be a role of intraflagellar transport (IFT) polypeptides in the formation of the immune synapse in non ciliated cells. The flagellum, in addition to being a sensory and motile organelle, is also a secretory organelle. A number of IFT components are expressed in haematopoietic cells, which have no cilia, indicating an unexpected role of IFT proteins in immune synapse-assembly and intracellular membrane trafficking in T lymphocytes; this suggests that the immune synapse could represent the functional homolog of the primary cilium in these cells.	109		Intraflagellar transport complex B, subunit 20	Intraflagellar transport complex B

03412	Peptidase_CA	Peptidase clan CA	367483	4	7.113002600762706e-08	Peptidase_C39	Peptidase C39 family. Lantibiotic and non-lantibiotic bacteriocins are synthesized as precursor peptides containing N-terminal extensions (leader peptides) which are cleaved off during maturation. Most non-lantibiotics and also some lantibiotics have leader peptides of the so-called double-glycine type. These leader peptides share consensus sequences and also a common processing site with two conserved glycine residues in positions -1 and -2. The double- glycine-type leader peptides are unrelated to the N-terminal signal sequences which direct proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane via the sec pathway. Their processing sites are also different from typical signal peptidase cleavage sites, suggesting that a different processing enzyme is involved. Peptide bacteriocins are exported across the cytoplasmic membrane by a dedicated ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter. The ABC transporter is the maturation protease and its proteolytic domain resides in the N-terminal part of the protein. This peptidase domain is found in a wide range of ABC transporters, however the presumed catalytic cysteine and histidine are not conserved in all members of this family.	133	CL0125	Peptidase C39 family	Peptidase clan CA

Neuromuscular junction formation relies upon the clustering of acetylcholine receptors and other proteins in the muscle membrane. Rapsyn is a peripheral membrane protein that is selectively concentrated at the neuromuscular junction and is essential for the formation of synaptic acetylcholine receptor aggregates. Acetylcholine receptors fail to aggregate beneath nerve terminals in mice where rapsyn has been knocked out. The N-terminal six amino acids of rapsyn are its myristoylation site, and myristoylation is necessary for the targeting of the protein to the membrane.	80	CL0020	Rapsyn N-terminal myristoylation and linker region	Tetratrico peptide repeat superfamily

18486			436538	4	7.113002600762706e-08	PUB_1	PNGase/UBA- or UBX-containing domain. This is a PUB domain (PNGase/UBA- or UBX-containing domain), found in E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase RNF31, also known as Ring finger protein 31 and HOIL-1-interacting protein (HOIP) (EC:2.3.2.27). RNF31/HOIP is observed to contribute to inborn human immunity disorders, in which RNF31/HOIP missense mutation at PUB domain gives rise to the de-stabilized LUBAC complex (linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex) and subsequently causes the auto-inflammation and immunodeficiency. In addition, RNF31 is reported to modify ERK and JNK pathways leading to cisplatin resistance. Functional studies indicate that HOIP and OTULIN interact and act as a bimolecular editing pair for linear ubiquitin signals where the HOIP-PUB domain binds to the PUB interacting motif (PIM) of OTULIN and the chaperone VCP/p9. This interaction plays an important role where the HOIP binding to OTULIN is required for the recruitment of OTULIN to the TNF receptor complex and to counteract HOIP-dependent activation of the NF-KB pathway.	64		PNGase/UBA- or UBX-containing domain	PNGase/UBA- or UBX-containing domain

In Bacillus subtilis, sigM (yhdM) gene, is required for growth and survival after salt stress. Expression of sigM is positively autoregulated and is controlled by growth phase and medium composition. SigM-dependent transcription is regulated by the products of both the yhdL and the yhdK genes, which are co-transcribed with the sigM gene. The small hydrophobic protein YhdK, appears to interact with the trans-membrane domain of YhdL, suggesting some specific role for YhdK in the anti-sigma function of YhdL.	96		Sigma-M inhibitor	Sigma-M inhibitor

02170	PAZ	PAZ domain superfamily	426635	4	7.113002600762706e-08	PAZ	PAZ domain. This domain is named PAZ after the proteins Piwi Argonaut and Zwille. This domain is found in two families of proteins that are involved in post-transcriptional gene silencing. These are the Piwi family and the Dicer family, that includes the Carpel factory protein. The function of the domains is unknown but has been suggested to mediate complex formation between proteins of the Piwi and Dicer families by hetero-dimerization. The three-dimensional structure of this domain has been solved. The PAZ domain is composed of two subdomains. One subdomain is similar to the OB fold, albeit with a different topology. The OB-fold is well known as a single-stranded nucleic acid binding fold. The second subdomain is composed of a beta-hairpin followed by an alpha-helix. The PAZ domains shows low-affinity nucleic acid binding and appears to interact with the 3' ends of single-stranded regions of RNA in the cleft between the two subdomains. PAZ can bind the characteristic two-base 3' overhangs of siRNAs, indicating that although PAZ may not be a primary nucleic acid binding site in Dicer or RISC, it may contribute to the specific and productive incorporation of siRNAs and miRNAs into the RNAi pathway.	117	CL0638	PAZ domain	PAZ domain superfamily

18442			375868	4	7.113002600762706e-08	G2BR	E3 gp78 Ube2g2-binding region (G2BR). The activity of RING finger ubiquitin ligases (E3) is dependent on their ability to facilitate transfer of ubiquitin from ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2) to substrates. The G2BR domain within the E3 gp78 binds selectively and with high affinity to the E2 Ube2g2. Binding to the G2BR results in conformational changes in Ube2g2 that affect ubiquitin loading. The Ube2g2-G2BR interaction also causes a 50-fold increase in affinity between the E2 and RING finger. Hence, the Ube2g2-binding region (G2BR) is required for the function of gp78. In yeast, Ubc7p, the ortholog of Ube2g2, is recruited by Cue1p to the ER membrane. Cue1p directly binds Ubc7p through a stretch of 50 aa domain analogous to G2BR, i.e. suggesting that this domain which activates ERAD and Hrd1p stimulating ubiquitylation, might be the yeast equivalent of the G2BR domain.	26		E3 gp78 Ube2g2-binding region (G2BR)	E3 gp78 Ube2g2-binding region (G2BR)

This domain occurs at the N-terminal of Afi1, an Arf3p-interacting protein, is a protein necessary for vesicle trafficking in yeast. This domain is the interacting region of the protein which binds to Arf3, the highly conserved small GTPases (ADP-ribosylation factors). Afi1 is distributed asymmetrically at the plasma membrane and is required for polarized distribution of Arf3 but not of an Arf3 guanine nucleotide-exchange factor, Yel1p. However, Afi1 is not required for targeting of Arf3 or Yel1p to the plasma membrane. Afi1 functions as an Arf3 polarization-specific adapter and participates in development of polarity. Although Arf3 is the homolog of human Arf6 it does not function in the same way, not being necessary for endocytosis or for mating factor receptor internalization. In the S phase, however, it is concentrated at the plasma membrane of the emerging bud. Because of its polarized localization and its critical function in the normal budding pattern of yeast, Arf3 is probably a regulator of vesicle trafficking, which is important for polarized growth.	119	CL0330	Docking domain of Afi1 for Arf3 in vesicle trafficking	Late secretory pathway transport machinery

18494			436542	3	5.3347519505720304e-08	Pullulanase_Ins	Pullulanase Ins domain. Pullulanases (pullulan 6-glucanohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.41) are debranching enzymes that are able to hydrolyze the alpha-1,6-glycosidic linkage in pullulan, starch, amylopectin, and related oligosaccharides. Type I pullulanases specifically cleave the alpha-1,6-glycosidic linkages in pullulan and branched oligosaccharides to produce maltotriose and linear oligosaccharides, respectively. Structural analysis of Klebsiella lipoprotein pullulanase (PulA) illustrates that the catalytic core is composed of two major regions: the TIM-barrel domain A and beta-sandwich fold domain C. PulA contains an extra domain, a highly mobile Ins subdomain of unknown function which is inserted into the catalytic TIM-barrel domain A of Klebsiella pullulanases. The Ins subdomain is rich in helical and loop secondary structure. A disulfide bond between Cys491 and Cys506 and two Ca2+ ions presumably stabilizes this domain.This insertion is also found in pullulanases from other Gram-negative genera that have a functional T2SS, such as Vibrio, Aeromonas, and Photorhabdus. Functional analysis indicate that this domain is required for PulA secretion via the T2SS.	74		Pullulanase Ins domain	Pullulanase Ins domain
11571			402942	3	5.3347519505720304e-08	Med27	Mediator complex subunit 27. Mediator is a large complex of up to 33 proteins that is conserved from plants to fungi to humans - the number and representation of individual subunits varying with species {1-2]. It is arranged into four different sections, a core, a head, a tail and a kinase-activity part, and the number of subunits within each of these is what varies with species. Overall, Mediator regulates the transcriptional activity of RNA polymerase II but it would appear that each of the four different sections has a slightly different function. Mediator exists in two major forms in human cells: a smaller form that interacts strongly with pol II and activates transcription, and a large form that does not interact strongly with pol II and does not directly activate transcription. The ubiquitous expression of Med27 mRNA suggests a universal requirement for Med27 in transcriptional initiation. Loss of Crsp34/Med27 decreases amacrine cell number, but increases the number of rod photoreceptor cells.	85		Mediator complex subunit 27	Mediator complex subunit 27

The family is found in association with pfam00092. There are two conserved sequence motifs: STF and DVD. There are two completely conserved residues (E and N) that may be functionally important. In hemostasis, platelet adhesion to the damaged vessel wall is mediated by several proteins, including von Willebrand factor. In solution vWF becomes immobilized via its A3 domain on the fibrillar collagen of the vessel wall and acts as an intermediary between collagen and the platelet receptor glycoprotein Ibalpha (GPIbalpha), which is the only platelet receptor that does not require prior activation for bond formation.	94		von Willebrand factor	von Willebrand factor

TetR family regulators are involved in the transcriptional control of multidrug efflux pumps, pathways for the biosynthesis of antibiotics, response to osmotic stress and toxic chemicals, control of catabolic pathways, differentiation processes, and pathogenicity. The TetR proteins identified in overm ultiple genera of bacteria and archaea share a common helix-turn-helix (HTH) structure in their DNA-binding domain. However, TetR proteins can work in different ways: they can bind a target operator directly to exert their effect (e.g. TetR binds Tet(A) gene to repress it in the absence of tetracycline), or they can be involved in complex regulatory cascades in which the TetR protein can either be modulated by another regulator or TetR can trigger the cellular response. TetR regulates the expression of the membrane-associated tetracycline resistance protein, TetA, which exports the tetracycline antibiotic out of the cell before it can attach to the ribosomes and inhibit protein synthesis. TetR blocks transcription from the genes encoding both TetA and TetR in the absence of antibiotic. The C-terminal domain is multi-helical and is interlocked in the homodimer with the helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding domain. This entry represents the C-terminal domain present in putative TetR family transcriptional regulators found in bacteria.	120	CL0174	Tetracyclin repressor-like, C-terminal domain	TetR protein, C-terminal domain-like

17988			375470	3	5.3347519505720304e-08	VEGFR-2_TMD	VEGFR-2 Transmembrane domain. This is a transmembrane domain (TMD) of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 which regulates blood vessel homeostasis. Transmembrane signalling by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) requires specific orientation of the intracellular kinase domains in active receptor dimers. Two mutants in VEGFR-2 TMD showed constitutive kinase activity, suggesting that precise TMD orientation is mandatory for kinase activation. Scanning mutagenesis and structural analysis indicated that introducing two polar amino acids in distinct positions of the TMD (G770E/F777E and I771E/L778E mutations) reorients transmembrane helices and leads to stable dimer formation. Therefore, it has been suggested that the transition between the inactive and the active dimeric state of VEGFR-2 implicates alternative dimeric TMD conformations.	35		VEGFR-2 Transmembrane domain	VEGFR-2 Transmembrane domain

The structure of the domain shows an overall fold consisting of a twisted five-stranded beta sheet surrounded by several alpha helices. The Hsp90 chaperone machinery in eukaryotes comprises a number of distinct accessory factors. Cns1 is one of the few essential co-chaperones in yeast. Cns1 is important for maintaining translation elongation, specifically chaperoning the elongation factor eEF2. In this context, Cns1 interacts with the novel co-factor Hgh1 and forms a quaternary complex together with eEF2 and Hsp90.	114		Cns1/TTC4 Wheel domain	Cns1/TTC4 Wheel domain

This is the very C-terminal region of a subfamily of nuclear receptors that includes oestrogen receptors and other subfamily 3 group A members. The actual function of this region is not known, but the domain is absent from all the other types of nuclear receptors. Oestrogen receptors modulate AP-1-dependent transcription through two distinct mechanisms: via protein-protein interactions on DNA; and via non-genomic actions. The mechanism used depends on the cellular localization of the receptor. In addition to the more extensively studied cross-talk on DNA, additional non-genomic actions might be very important in target tissues in which membrane-associated ERs are found. These non-genomic actions probably contribute to the overall physiological responses mediated by ligand-bound ERs and might possibly be mediated via this C-terminal domain.	44		Oestrogen-type nuclear receptor final C-terminal	Oestrogen-type nuclear receptor final C-terminal

It is thought that the first leucine zipper and homeodomain 1 (HD1)of Homez is responsible for dimerization and HD2 has a specific DNA-binding activity. Homez is also thought to function as a transcriptional repressor due to the acidic region in its C-terminal domain.

18026			436219	3	5.3347519505720304e-08	Exog_C	Endo/exonuclease (EXOG) C-terminal domain. This is the C-terminal domain found in EndoG-like mitochondrial endo/exonuclease (EXOG) proteins in higher eukaryotes. Evolutionary conserved mitochondrial nucleases are involved in programmed cell death and normal cell proliferation in lower and higher eukaryotes. It has been proposed that during metazoan evolution duplication of an ancestral nuclease gene could have generated the paralogous EndoG- and EXOG-protein subfamilies in higher eukaryotes, thereby maintaining the full endo/exonuclease activity found in mitochondria of lower eukaryotes. Family members include the human EXOG, a dimeric mitochondrial enzyme that displays 5'-3' exonuclease activity and further differs from EndoG in substrate specificity. This C-terminal domain is predicted to fold into a coiled-coil structure. Deletion of the domain led to a pronounced reduction in EXOG activity, revealing that the presence and most likely the proper positioning of this domain in EXOG proteins is crucial for its enzymatic activity.	49		Endo/exonuclease (EXOG) C-terminal domain	Endo/exonuclease (EXOG) C-terminal domain

The Myc-Max dimer is a transactivating complex activating expression of growth related genes promoting cell proliferation. The dimerization is facilitated via interdigitating leucine residues every 7th position of the alpha helix. Like charge repulsion of adjacent residues in this region perturbs the formation of homodimers with heterodimers being promoted by opposing charge attractions.	27		Myc leucine zipper domain	Myc leucine zipper domain

03073			427122	3	5.3347519505720304e-08	TspO_MBR	TspO/MBR family. Tryptophan-rich sensory protein (TspO) is an integral membrane protein that acts as a negative regulator of the expression of specific photosynthesis genes in response to oxygen/light. It is involved in the efflux of porphyrin intermediates from the cell. This reduces the activity of coproporphyrinogen III oxidase, which is thought to lead to the accumulation of a putative repressor molecule that inhibits the expression of specific photosynthesis genes. Several conserved aromatic residues are necessary for TspO function: they are thought to be involved in binding porphyrin intermediates. In, the rat mitochondrial peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (MBR) was shown to not only retain its structure within a bacterial outer membrane, but also to be able to functionally substitute for TspO in TspO- mutants, and to act in a similar manner to TspO in its in situ location: the outer mitochondrial membrane. The biological significance of MBR remains unclear, however. It is thought to be involved in a variety of cellular functions, including cholesterol transport in steroidogenic tissues.	144		TspO/MBR family	TspO/MBR family

05778			428624	3	5.3347519505720304e-08	Apo-CIII	Apolipoprotein CIII (Apo-CIII). This family consists of several mammalian apolipoprotein CIII (Apo-CIII) sequences. Apolipoprotein C-III is a 79-residue glycoprotein. It is synthesized in the intestine and liver as part of the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and the high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles. Owing to its positive correlation with plasma triglyceride (Tg) levels, Apo-CIII is suggested to play a role in Tg metabolism and is therefore of interest regarding atherosclerosis. However, unlike other apolipoproteins such as Apo-AI, Apo E or CII for which many naturally occurring mutations are known, the structure-function relationships of apo C-III remains a subject of debate. One possibility is that apo C-III inhibits lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity, as shown by in vitro experiments. Another suggestion, is that elevated levels of Apo-CIII displace other apolipoproteins at the lipoprotein surface, modifying their clearance from plasma.	69		Apolipoprotein CIII (Apo-CIII)	Apolipoprotein CIII (Apo-CIII)

Sequence analysis has showed that the SANTA domain is likely to form four central beta-sheets with three flanking alpha- helixes. Many conserved hydrophobic residues are present which implying a possible role in protein-protein interactions.	87		SANTA (SANT Associated)	SANTA (SANT Associated)

The nuclear RNase P of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is made up of at least nine protein subunits; Pop1, Pop3, Pop4, Pop5, Pop6, Pop7, Pop8, Rpr2 and Rpp1. Many of these subunits seem to be present also in the RNase MRP, with the exception of Rpr2 (Rpp21) which is unique to RNase P. Human nuclear RNase P and MRP appear to contain at least 10 protein subunits, Rpp14, Rpp20, Rpp21, Rpp25, Rpp29, Rpp30, Rpp38, Rpp40, hPop1 and hPop5, although there is recent evidence that not all of these subunits are shared between P and MRP. Archaeal RNase P has at least four protein subunits homologous to eukaryotic RNase P/MRP proteins. In the yeast RNase P, Pop6 and Pop7 (the Rpp20 homolog) interact with each other and they are both interaction partners of Pop4; in the human MRP Rpp25 and Rpp20 interact with each other and Rpp25 binds to Rpp29 (Pop4).	118	CL0441	Rpp20 subunit of nuclear RNase MRP and P	RNA-DNA binding Alba-like superfamily

E2F transcription factors play an essential role in cell proliferation and apoptosis and their activity is frequently deregulated in human cancers. E2F activity is regulated by a variety of mechanisms, frequently mediated by proteins binding to individual members or a subgroup of the family. EAPP interacts with a subset of E2F factors and influences E2F-dependent promoter activity. EAPP is present throughout the cell cycle but disappears during mitosis.	133		E2F-associated phosphoprotein	E2F-associated phosphoprotein

14603	SH3	Src homology-3 domain	434065	2	3.556501300381353e-08	hSH3	Helically-extended SH3 domain. This domain is the 70 C-terminal residues of ADAP - Adhesion and de-granulation promoting adapter protein. It shows homology to SH3 domains; however, conserved residues of the fold are absent. It thus represents an altered SH3 domain fold. An N-terminal, amphipathic, helix makes extensive contacts to residues of the regular SH3 domain fold thereby creating a composite surface with unusual surface properties. The domain can no longer bind conventional proline-rich peptides. There are key phosphorylation sites within the two hSH3 domains and it would appear that binding at these sites does not materially affect the folding of these regions although the equilibrium towards the unfolded state may be slightly altered. The binding partners of the hSH3 domains are still unknown.	89	CL0010	Helically-extended SH3 domain	Src homology-3 domain

This protein is responsible for attachment of long tail fibers to virus particle, and forms the 'whiskers' or fibers on the neck of the virion. The region seen in this family contains an N-terminal coiled-coil portion and the C-terminal globular foldon domain (residues 457-486), which is essential for fibritin trimerisation and folding. This domain consists of a beta-hairpin; three such hairpins come together in a beta-propeller-like arrangement in the trimer, which is stabilized by hydrogen bonds, salt bridges and hydrophobic interactions.	93		Fibritin C-terminal region	Fibritin C-terminal region

However, since they do not contain the canonical pattern of calcium binding residues found in many EF hand domains, they do not bind calcium ions. The main function of this domain is the provision of specificity in beta-dystroglycan recognition, though in dystrophin it serves an additional role: stabilisation of the WW domain (pfam00397), enhancing dystroglycan binding.	90	CL0220	EF-hand	EF-hand like superfamily
17317			407425	2	3.556501300381353e-08	MFA1_2	Mating hormone A-factor 1&2. The polypeptides encoded by the MFa1 and MFa2 genes are precursors of 36 and 38 amino acids, respectively. These mating pheromones secreted by S. cerevisiae a-cells, exhibit a single amino acid residue difference (the MFa1 gene product contains a valine instead of the leucine coded for by MFa2 at position 6 of the mature a-factor). The most significant feature of the primary a-factor gene products is the presence of a specific C-terminal motif, found in all known farnesylated proteins, representing a signal for modification of polypeptides with an isoprenoid group. In the case of both a-factor precursors, this specific sequence of amino acids is -CVIA. However, the general motif is referred to as a CAAX box, since the consensus sequence of amino acids present at the C-terminus of isoprenylated proteins consists of an invariable cysteine (C) residue followed by two aliphatic (A) amino acids and ending in a carboxyl-terminal residue of almost any (X) type The specific CAAX sequence has also been shown to target the peptide for either farnesylation or geranylgeranylation.	34		Mating hormone A-factor 1&2	Mating hormone A-factor 1&2

Sequence similarity between netrin UNC-6 and C345C complement protein family members, and hence the existence of the UNC-6 module, was first reported in. Subsequently, many additional members of the family were identified on the basis of sequence similarity between the C-terminal domains of netrins, complement proteins C3, C4, C5, secreted frizzled-related proteins, and type I pro-collagen C-proteinase enhancer proteins (PCOLCEs), which are homologous with the N-terminal domains of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs).

Alpha-2-macroglobulins (A2Ms) are plasma proteins that trap and inhibit a broad range of proteases and are major components of the eukaryotic innate immune system. However, A2M-like proteins were identified in pathogenically invasive bacteria and species that colonize higher eukaryotes. Bacterial A2Ms are located in the periplasm where they are believed to provide protection to the cell by trapping external proteases through a covalent interaction with an activated thioester. This domain is found on the C-terminal region in A2Ms in bacteria. Structure analysis of Salmonella enterica ser A2Ms (SA-A2Ms) show that they are composed of 13 domains, all of which fold as variants of beta sandwiches with the exception of the TED, which consists of 14 alpha helices. Most of the beta sandwich domains appear to serve a structural role and are referred to as the macroglobulin-like (MG) domains. This is the MG10 domain. MG10 is markedly different from the other MG domains in that it has more beta strands and an alpha helix. The position of MG10 is stabilized by, in addition to other hydrogen bonds, the formation of a beta sheet with MG9.	128	CL0159	Bacterial Alpha-2-macroglobulin MG10 domain	Ig-like fold superfamily (E-set)

This is a cysteine-rich domain termed ADD (ATRX-DNMT3-DNMT3L, AD-DATRX) found in ATRX proteins. Chromatin-associated human protein ATRX was originally identified because mutations in the ATRX gene cause a severe form of syndromal X-linked mental retardation called ATR-X syndrome. Mutations or knockdown of ATRX expression cause diverse effects, including altered patterns of DNA methylation, a telomere-dysfunction phenotype, aberrant chromosome segregation, premature sister chromatid separation and changes in gene expression. ATRX localizes predominantly to large, tandemly repeated regions (such as telomeres, centromeres and ribosomal DNA) associated with heterochromatin, and studies show that it directs H3.3 deposition to pericentric and telomeric heterochromatin. The ADD domain of ATRX, in which most syndrome-causing mutations occur, engages the N-terminal tail of histone H3 through two rigidly oriented binding pockets, one for unmodified Lys4 and the other for di- or trimethylated Lys9. Mutations in the ATRX ADD domain cause mislocalization of ATRX protein to heterochromatin, and this may contribute to understanding the underlying etiology of ATRX syndrome. Structure analysis of the ADD domain of ATRX revealed that it contains a PHD zinc-finger domain packed against a GATA-like zinc finger. Same structure is also found in the DNMT3 DNA methyltransferases and DNMT3L.	56	CL0390	Cysteine Rich ADD domain	FYVE/PHD zinc finger superfamily

Further copies of the same EAD are fused to either effector or signal-transducing domains, or additional EADs. EAD pairs are frequently observed together on the genome in conserved gene neighborhoods, but can also be severed from such neighborhoods and located in distant regions, indicating EAD-EAD protein domain coupling attenuates collinear transcription requirements.	77	CL0699	Effector-associated domain 10	EAD1-like clan

The SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase) complex performs multiple functions in transcription activation including deubiquitinating histone H2B, which is mediated by a subcomplex called the deubiquitinating module (DUBm). The yeast DUBm comprises a catalytic subunit, Ubp8, and three additional subunits, Sgf11, Sus1 and Sgf73, all of which are required for DUBm activity. A portion of the non-globular Sgf73 subunit lies between the Ubp8 catalytic domain and the zinc finger (ZnF)-UBP domain and has been proposed to contribute to deubiquitinating activity by maintaining the catalytic domain in an active conformation. Sgf73 contributes to maintaining both the organization and ubiquitin-binding conformation of Ubp8, thereby contributing to overall DUBm activity. This domain is a Sgf73 fragment in the DUB module. It is a zinc finger (ZnF) domain whose integrity is essential for the incorporation of this subunit into DUBm as well as for the catalytic activity of Ubp8, as either a short deletion or point mutations in Sgf73 zinc-coordinating residues disrupt the association of Sgf73 with the rest of the DUBm.	42	CL0361	Zinc finger domain	Classical C2H2 and C2HC zinc fingers

The crystal structure of hydrazine synthase multiprotein complex isolated from the anammox organism Kuenenia stuttgartiensis implies a two-step mechanism for hydrazine synthesis: a three-electron reduction of nitric oxide to hydroxylamine at the active site of the gamma-subunit and its subsequent condensation with ammonia, yielding hydrazine in the active centre of the alpha-subunit. The alpha-subunit consists of three domains: an N-terminal domain which includes a six-bladed beta-propeller, a middle domain binding a pentacoordinated c-type haem (haem alphaI) and a C-terminal domain which harbours a bis-histidine-coordinated c-type haem (haem alphaII).

02457			426781	2	3.556501300381353e-08	DisA_N	DisA bacterial checkpoint controller nucleotide-binding. The DisA protein is a bacterial checkpoint protein that dimerizes into an octameric complex. The protein consists of three distinct domains. This domain is the first and is a globular, nucleotide-binding region; the next 146-289 residues constitute the DisA-linker family, pfam10635, that consists of an elongated bundle of three alpha helices (alpha-6, alpha-10, and alpha-11), one side of which carries an additional three helices (alpha7-9), which thus forms a spine like-linker between domains 1 and 3. The C-terminal residues, of domain 3, are represented by family HHH, pfam00633, the specific DNA-binding domain. The octameric complex thus has structurally linked nucleotide-binding and DNA-binding HhH domains and the nucleotide-binding domains are bound to a cyclic di-adenosine phosphate such that DisA is a specific di-adenylate cyclase. The di-adenylate cyclase activity is strongly suppressed by binding to branched DNA, but not to duplex or single-stranded DNA, suggesting a role for DisA as a monitor of the presence of stalled replication forks or recombination intermediates via DNA structure-modulated c-di-AMP synthesis.	114		DisA bacterial checkpoint controller nucleotide-binding	DisA bacterial checkpoint controller nucleotide-binding

17331			435870	2	3.556501300381353e-08	GFD1	GFD1 mRNA transport factor. Following transcription, mRNA is processed, packaged into messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) particles, and transported through nuclear pores (NPCs) to the cytoplasm. Gfd1 is one of several factors that, although not essential for mRNA export, enhances the efficiency of the process, either by facilitating integration of different steps in the gene expression pathway or by increasing the rate of key steps. Gfd1 localizes to the cytoplasm and nuclear rim. It interacts with a number of components of the mRNA export machinery in yeast. Most notably, Gfd1 interacts with the Dbp5-activating protein, Gle1, the cytoplasmic nucleoporin Nup42/Rip1, the putative RNA helicase, Dbp5, and a protein implicated in mRNA export, Zds1. Gfd1 forms a complex with Nab2 both in vitro and in vivo in which Gfd1 binds to the N-terminal domain of Nab2. The crystal structure, together with complementary NMR data, indicated that residues 126-150 of Gfd1 form a single alpha-helix that binds primarily to helix 2 of Nab2-N. Gfd1 functions to co-ordinate Dbp5 and Gle1 to facilitate the removal of Nab2 from mRNPs at the cytoplasmic face of nuclear pores.	44		GFD1 mRNA transport factor	GFD1 mRNA transport factor

14812			434232	2	3.556501300381353e-08	PBP1_TM	Transmembrane domain of transglycosylase PBP1 at N-terminal. This is the N-terminal, transmembrane, domain of the transglycosylases ()penicillin-binding proteins), the multi-domain membrane proteins essential for cell wall synthesis that are targeted by penicillin antibiotics. The TM domain is a single helix, several of whose residues lie in close proximity to hydrophobic residues in the TGT domain. The TM helix seems to be necessary for stabilizing the protein-membrane interaction, and the resulting orientation limits the interaction between PBPb1 and lipid II in the membrane in a 2D lateral diffusion fashion.	85		Transmembrane domain of transglycosylase PBP1 at N-terminal	Transmembrane domain of transglycosylase PBP1 at N-terminal

03121			367342	2	3.556501300381353e-08	Herpes_UL52	Herpesviridae UL52/UL70 DNA primase. Herpes simplex virus type 1 DNA replication in host cells is known to be mediated by seven viral-encoded proteins, three of which form a heterotrimeric DNA helicase-primase complex. This complex consists of UL5, UL8, and UL52 subunits. Heterodimers consisting of UL5 and UL52 have been shown to retain both helicase and primase activities. Nevertheless, UL8 is still essential for replication: though it lacks any DNA binding or catalytic activities, it is involved in the transport of UL5-UL52 and it also interacts with other replication proteins. The molecular mechanisms of the UL5-UL52 catalytic activities are not known. While UL5 is associated with DNA helicase activity and UL52 with DNA primase activity, the helicase activity requires the interaction of UL5 and UL52. It is not known if the primase activity can be maintained by UL52 alone. The region encompassed by residues 610-636 of HSV1 UL52 is thought to contain a divalent metal cation binding motif. Indeed, this region contains several aspartate and glutamate residues that might be involved in divalent cation binding. The biological significance of UL52-UL8 interaction is not known. Yeast two-hybrid analysis together with immunoprecipitation experiments have shown that the HSV1 UL52 region between residues 366-914 is essential for this interaction, while the first 349 N-terminal residues are dispensable. This family also includes protein UL70 from cytomegalovirus (CMV, a subgroup of the Herpesviridae) strains, which, by analogy with UL52, is thought to have DNA primase activity. Indeed, CMV strains also possess a DNA helicase-primase complex, the other subunits being protein UL105 (with known similarity to HSV1 UL5) and protein UL102.	75		Herpesviridae UL52/UL70 DNA primase	Herpesviridae UL52/UL70 DNA primase
02986			397232	2	3.556501300381353e-08	Fn_bind	Fibronectin binding repeat. The ability of bacteria to bind fibronectin is thought to enable the colonisation of wound tissue and blood clots. The fibronectin binding repeat is found in bacterial fibronectin binding proteins and serum opacity factor. Bacterial fibronectin binding proteins are surface proteins that covalently link to the bacterial cell wall, mediate adherence of the bacteria to host cells and trigger the fibronectin/integrin-mediated uptake of bacteria by host cells. Each fibronectin binding repeat is an array of short motifs that bind to fibronectin type I domains. Fibronectin binding repeats are natively unfolded in the absence of fibronectin and are thought to adopt a well-defined conformation (tandem beta-zipper) upon binding.	33		Fibronectin binding repeat	Fibronectin binding repeat

Clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) loci play a pivotal role in the prokaryotic host defense system against invading genetic materials. The CRISPR loci are transcribed to produce CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs), which form interference complexes with CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins to target the invading nucleic acid for degradation. Four Cas proteins (Cas5, Cas6b, Cas7 and Cas8b) are proposed to form a Type I-B Cascade complex that mediates the antiviral defense. This is the N-terminal domain found in Cas6b proteins. Cas6b is a member of Cas6 RNA processing endoribonucleases found in bacteria and archaea whose RNA substrates have a wide range of structural features. Cocrystal structures of Cas6 from Methanococcus maripaludis (MmCas6b) bound with its repeat RNA revealed a dual-site binding structure and a cleavage site conformation poised for phosphodiester bond breakage.	105	CL0362	Cas6b N-terminal domain	CRISPR-associated (Cas) Repair Associated Mysterious Proteins

The crystal structure of the MH1 domain shows that a highly conserved 11 residue beta hairpin is used to bind the DNA consensus sequence GNCN in the major groove, shown to be vital for the transcriptional activation of target genes. Not all examples of MH1 can bind to DNA however. Smad2 cannot bind DNA and has a large insertion within the hairpin that presumably abolishes DNA binding. A basic helix (H2) in MH1 with the nuclear localization signal KKLKK has been shown to be essential for Smad3 nuclear import. Smads also use the MH1 domain to interact with transcription factors such as Jun, TFE3, Sp1, and Runx.	103	CL0263	MH1 domain	His-Me finger endonuclease superfamily

The two haem groups have significantly different redox potentials. The high potential (+320 mV) haem feeds electrons from electron shuttle proteins to the low potential (-330 mV) haem, where peroxide is reduced (indeed, the low potential site is known as the peroxidatic site). The CCP protein itself is structured into two domains, each containing one c-type haem group, with a calcium-binding site at the domain interface. This family also includes MauG proteins, whose similarity to di-haem CCP was previously recognized.	151	CL0318	Di-haem cytochrome c peroxidase	Cytochrome c superfamily
10680			431432	2	3.556501300381353e-08	RRN9	RNA polymerase I specific transcription initiation factor. Initiation of transcription of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) in yeast involves an interaction of upstream activation factor (UAF) with the upstream element of the promoter, to form a stable UAF-template complex. UAF, together with the TATA-binding transcription initiation factor protein TBP, then recruits an essential core factor to the promoter, to form a stable preinitiation complex. This Rrn9 domain, which seems to be constrained to fungi, is the two highly conserved regions of proteins which form one of the subunits of UAF and appears to be the region responsible for the interaction with TBP. The family includes the S.pombe Arc1 protein, which is found to be essential for the accumulation of condensin at kinetochores.	65		RNA polymerase I specific transcription initiation factor	RNA polymerase I specific transcription initiation factor

LINC complexes are formed by coupling of KASH (Klarsicht, ANC-1, and Syne/Nesprin Homology) and SUN (Sad1 and UNC-84) proteins from the inner and outer nuclear membranes (INM and ONM, respectively). the formation of LINC complexes by KASH and SUN proteins at the nuclear envelope (NE) establishes the physical linkage between the cytoskeleton and nuclear lamina, which is instrumental for the mechanical force transmission from the cytoplasm to the nuclear interior, and is essential for cellular processes such as nuclear positioning and migration, centrosome-nucleus anchorage, and chromosome dynamics. SUN2 possesses two coiled-coil domains (CC1 and CC2). These coiled-coil domains are also believed to act as rigid spacers to delineate the distance between the ONM and INM of the NE. Furthermore, the two coiled-coil domains of SUN2 have been indicated to be able to directly modulate SUN domain activity and regulate the subsequent interactions between the SUN and KASH domains. CC2 forms a three-helix bundle to lock the SUN domain in an inactive conformation acting as an inhibitory component. Structure-based sequence analysis demonstrated that several Gly residues are located in the flexible linker regions between the three helices which would ideally provide the breaks/turns in CC2 for three-helix bundle formation. The last helix alpha3 of CC2 (that is immediately connected to the SUN domain) has been shown to be an essential segment for promoting SUN domain trimerization in the SUN-KASH complex structure.	58	CL0123	SUN2 helix-turn-helix domain	Helix-turn-helix clan

The BBSome (so-named after the association with Bardet-Biedl syndrome) is a complex of 8 subunits that lies at the base of the flagellar microtubule structure. The precise function of all the individual components in cilia formation is unclear, however they function to promote loading of cargo to the ciliary axoneme. The primary cilium, a slim microtubule-based organelle that projects from the surface of vertebrate cells has crucial roles in vertebrate development and human genetic diseases. Cilia are required for the response to developmental signals, and evidence is accumulating that the primary cilium is specialized for Hedgehog (Hh) signal transduction. Formation of cilia, in turn, is regulated by other signalling pathways, possibly including the planar cell polarity pathway. The connections between cilia and developmental signalling have begun to clarify the basis of human diseases associated with ciliary dysfunction. BBS2 is one of the three Bardet-Biedl syndrome subunits that is required for leptin receptor signalling in the hypothalamus, and BBS2 and 4 are also required for the localization of somatostatin receptor 3 and melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 into neuronal cilia.	107	CL0186	Ciliary BBSome complex subunit 2, N-terminal	Beta propeller clan

This is the ZF1 (Zinc Finger 1) domain found in Zic family proteins found in Eukaryotes. In humans, there are five members of the Zic family that are involved in human congenital anomalies. One of them, ZIC3, causes X-linked heterotaxy (HTX1), which is a left-right axis disturbance that manifests as variable combinations of heart malformation, altered lung lobation, splenic abnormality and gastrointestinal malrotation. Zic faily proteins contain multiple zinc finger domains (ZFD), which are generally composed of five tandemly repeated C2H2 zinc finger (ZF) motifs. Sequence comparison analysis reveal that this N-terminal ZF (ZF1) domain of the Zic zinc finger domains is unique in that it possesses more amino acid residues (6-38 amino acids) between the two cysteine residues of the C2H2 motif compared to Gli and Glis ZF1s or any of the other ZFs (ZF2-5) in the Gli/Glis/Zic superfamily of proteins. Mutations in cysteine 253 (C253S) or histidine 286 (H286R) in ZIC3 ZF1, which are found in heterotaxy patients, result in extranuclear localization of the mutant ZIC3 protein. Furthermore, mutations in the evolutionarily conserved amino acid residues (C253, W255, C268, H281 and H286) of ZF1 generally impair nuclear localization.	45	CL0361	Zic proteins zinc finger domain	Classical C2H2 and C2HC zinc fingers

Moreover, this basic domain in FKBP25 forms alternative complexes with other chromatin-related proteins, such as the HDAC1, HDAC2, and the transcriptional regulator YY1, the DNA binding activity of which is enhanced on binding FKBP25. Structural analysis of this fold suggests that the DNA binding properties of FKBP25 and HectD1 are presented by the conserved basic region.	72	CL0306	Basic tilted helix bundle domain	LEM/SAP HeH motif

Effectors are low molecular weight proteins that are secreted by bacteria, oomycetes and fungi to manipulate their hosts and adapt to their environment. Ecp2 is a 165 amino acid secreted protein that was originally identified as a virulence factor in C. fulvum, since disruption reduces virulence of the fungus on tomato plants. We have recently determined that Ecp2 is a member of a novel, widely distributed and highly diversified within the fungal kingdom multigene superfamily, which we have designated Hce2, for Homologs of C. fulvum Ecp2 effector. Although Ecp2 is present in most organisms as a small secreted protein, the mature part of this protein can be found fused to other protein domains, including the fungal Glycoside Hydrolase family 18, Glyco_hydro_18 pfam00704 and other, unknown, protein domains.

This is a family of transcription elongation factors which includes those referred to as Bex proteins as well as those named TCEAL7. Bex1 was shown to be a novel link between neurotrophin signalling, the cell cycle, and neuronal differentiation, suggesting it might function by coordinating internal cellular states with the ability of cells to respond to external signals. TCEAL7 has been shown negatively to regulate the NF-kappaB pathway, hence being important in ovarian cancer as it one of the genes frequently downregulated in this cancer. A closely related protein, TFIIS/TCEA, found in pfam07500 is involved in transcription elongation and transcript fidelity. TFIIS/TCEA promotes 3' endoribonuclease activity of RNA polymerase II (pol II) and allows pol II to bypass transcript pause or 'arrest' during elongation process.

11594			431950	1	1.7782506501906765e-08	Med28	Mediator complex subunit 28. Mediator is a large complex of up to 33 proteins that is conserved from plants to fungi to humans - the number and representation of individual subunits varying with species. It is arranged into four different sections, a core, a head, a tail and a kinase-activity part, and the number of subunits within each of these is what varies with species. Overall, Mediator regulates the transcriptional activity of RNA polymerase II but it would appear that each of the four different sections has a slightly different function. Subunit Med28 of the Mediator may function as a scaffolding protein within Mediator by maintaining the stability of a submodule within the head module, and components of this submodule act together in a gene-regulatory programme to suppress smooth muscle cell differentiation. Thus, mammalian Mediator subunit Med28 functions as a repressor of smooth muscle-cell differentiation, which could have implications for disorders associated with abnormalities in smooth muscle cell growth and differentiation, including atherosclerosis, asthma, hypertension, and smooth muscle tumors.	101		Mediator complex subunit 28	Mediator complex subunit 28

This is an Ankyrin repeat domain found in TRABID (also known as Ubiquitin thioesterase ZRANB1) (EC:3.4.19.12). In TRABID, the first ankyrin repeat spans residues 260-290 and is connected to the second repeat residues 313-340 by a long linker that packs against what would correspond to the concave surface in an extended ankyrin-repeat structure. Ankyrin-repeat domains mediate protein interactions through a variety of surfaces.

This is the N-terminal domain found in debranching enzyme such as Pullulanase (PulA)from Anoxybacillus sp. LM18-11. The PulA structure comprises four domains (N1, N2, A, and C). This is the N1 domain which has been identified as a carbohydrate-binding motif. Two maltotriose or maltotetraose molecules were found between the N1 domain and a loop of the A domain in the PulA-maltotriose or PulA-maltotetraose structures. These carbohydrates are bound in a parallel binding mode close to each other and form hydrogen bonds. The sugar moieties bound to the N1 domain are not immediately adjacent to the active site, but the enzyme might use N1 binding to attract and grab the substrate. Functional analysis indicate that N1 is important for catalytic activity and thermostability in addition to assisting substrate binding. The structure of the N1 domain reveals a classic distorted beta-jelly roll fold consisting of two anti-parallel beta-sheets, forming a concave and a convex surface. On the concave side of N1 domain there is a cleft to accommodate two molecules of maltotriose or maltotetraose.	85	CL0202	Pullulanase N1-terminal domain	Galactose-binding domain-like superfamily
17388			435889	1	1.7782506501906765e-08	GP24_25	Tail assembly protein Gp24 and Gp25. Bacteriophages (viruses of bacteria) use a specialized organelle called a tail to deliver their genetic material and proteins across the cell envelope during infection. In phages the most complex part of these contractile injection systems, the base-plate, is responsible for coordinating host recognition or other environmental signals with sheath contraction. In T4 phage, 15 different proteins encoded by Gene Products (Gps), make up the base-plate and proximal region of the tail tube. The base-plate is divided into inner, intermediate and peripheral regions. Gp25 is located in the inner region of the base-plate. It interacts with Gp53 connecting the core bundle to the central hub and the tube, stabilizing the entire assembly. Gp25 has a structurally conserved loop (residues 47-49), mediating the interaction between LysM (residues 46-82 in Gp53) and the core bundle. Orthologues of Gp25 contain an EPR motif (Glu-Pro-Arg, residues 85-87 of Gp25), which interacts with the core bundle and points towards the region of the Gp27-Gp48 interface. In summary, Gp25 plays a critical role in sheath assembly and contraction. This domain family is found on Gp24 and Gp25 Mycobacterium phages.	121		Mycobacteriophage tail assembly protein	Mycobacteriophage tail assembly protein

The topology of the strands is exclusively antiparallel. The tailspike protein trimerizes through this domain, and the direction of the strands with respect to the molecular triad is almost parallel for beta-sheet A, whereas beta-sheet B is perpendicular to the triad, forming a dome-like structure. This domain is dispensable for thermostability and SDS resistance of the intact protein, and its deletion has only minor effects on tailspike folding kinetics.	103		Head binding	Head binding

This is a cysteine-rich domain termed ADD (ATRX-DNMT3-DNMT3L, AD-DATRX) found in DNMT3A proteins. The ADD domains of the DNMT3 family have a decisive role in blocking DNMT activity in the areas of the genome with chromatin containing methylated H3K4. Furthermore, the ADD domain of DNMMT3A (ADD-3A) competes with the chromodomain (CD) of heterochromatin protein 1 alpha (HP1alpha, CDHP1alpha) for binding to the H3 tail. The DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 3 family members DNMT3A and DNMT3B and the DNMT3-like non-enzymatic regulatory factor DNMT3L, are involved in de-novo establishment of DNA methylation patterns in early mammalian development.	56	CL0390	Cysteine rich ADD domain in DNMT3	FYVE/PHD zinc finger superfamily
12658	OB	OB fold	403757	1	1.7782506501906765e-08	Ten1	Telomere capping, CST complex subunit. Stn1 and Ten1 are DNA-binding proteins with specificity for telomeric DNA substrates and both protect chromosome termini from unregulated resection and regulate telomere length. Stn1 complexes with Ten1 and Cdc13 to function as a telomere-specific replication protein A (RPA)-like complex. These three interacting proteins associate with the telomeric overhang in budding yeast, whereas a single protein known as Pot1 (protection of telomeres-1) performs this function in fission yeast, and a two-subunit complex consisting of POT1 and TPP1 associates with telomeric ssDNA in humans. S.pombe has Stn1- and Ten1-like proteins that are essential for chromosome end protection. Stn1 orthologues exist in all species that have Pot1, whereas Ten1-like proteins can be found in all fungi. Fission yeast Stn1 and Ten1 localize at telomeres in a manner that correlates with the length of the ssDNA overhang, suggesting that they specifically associate with the telomeric ssDNA. Two separate protein complexes are required for chromosome end protection in fission yeast. Protection of telomeres by multiple proteins with OB-fold domains is conserved in eukaryotic evolution. Ten1 is one of the three components of the CST complex, which, in conjunction with the Shelterin complex helps protect telomeres from attack by DNA-repair mechanisms.	115	CL0021	Telomere capping, CST complex subunit	OB fold

06106			428772	1	1.7782506501906765e-08	SAUGI	S. aureus uracil DNA glycosylase inhibitor. Uracil-DNA glycosylase inhibitors, are DNA mimic proteins that prevent the DNA binding sites of UDGs (Uracil DNA glycosylase) from interacting with their DNA substrate. SSP0047 (SAUGI; for Staphylococcus aureus uracil-DNA glycosylase inhibitor) acts as a uracil-DNA glycosylase inhibitor that breaks the uracil-removing activity of S. aureus uracil-DNA glycosylase (SAUDG) pfam03167. The SAUGI/SAUDG complex has been determined, and shows that SAUGI binds to the SAUDG DNA binding region via several strong interactions, by using a hydrophobic pocket to hold SAUDG's protruding residue (i.e. SAUDG Leu184, E. coli UDG Leu191 and B. subtilis UDG Phe191). By binding to SAUDG in this way, SAUGI thus prevents SAUDG from binding to its DNA substrate and performing DNA repair activity.	112		S. aureus uracil DNA glycosylase inhibitor	S. aureus uracil DNA glycosylase inhibitor

Some of these proteins are also termed glycine-rich proteins (GRPs), due to the presence of a glycine-rich C-terminal region in their structures. Bacterial infection is required for the induction of nodule-specific GRP genes, and it is thought that nodule-specific GRPs may play non-redundant roles required at specific stages of nodule development. Members of this group of proteins may be cytosolic, whereas others are thought to be membrane-associated.	38		Nodule-specific GRP repeat	Nodule-specific GRP repeat

Together these form an N-shaped structure, with the loop allowing the two helices to assume a parallel orientation. The monomeric domains associate into a dimer through the formation of an antiparallel coiled coil between the alpha-2 helices and domain swapping of two alpha-1 helices, where one alpha-1 helix swings back and packs against the alpha-2 helix from the second monomer.

The misato protein contains three distinct, conserved domains, segments I, II and III. Segments I and III are common to Tubulins pfam00091, but segment II aligns with myosin heavy chain sequences from D. melanogaster (PIR C35815), rabbit (SP P04460), and human (PIR S12458). Segment II of misato is a major contributor to its greater length compared with the various tubulins. The most significant sequence similarities to this 54-amino acid region are from a motif found in the heavy chains of myosins from different organisms. A comparison of segment II with the vertebrate myosin heavy chains reveals that it is homologous to a myosin peptide in the hinge region linking the S2 and LMM domains. Segment II also contains heptad repeats which are characteristic of the myosin tail alpha-helical coiled-coils. This myosin-like homology may be due only to the fact that both myosin and Misato carry coiled-coils, which appear similar but are not necessarily homologous (Wood V, personal communication).	115	CL0566	Misato Segment II tubulin-like domain	Tubulin nucleotide-binding domain-like, GTPase

18669			436655	1	1.7782506501906765e-08	Trp_ring	Trimeric autotransporter adhesin Trp ring domain. Autotransporters are synthesized as precursor proteins with three functional domains, namely, an N-terminal signal peptide, an internal passenger domain, and a C-terminal pore-forming translocator domain. The C-terminal translocator domain is embedded in the outer membrane and facilitates delivery of the internal passenger domain to the bacterial surface. In conventional autotransporters, the C-terminal translocator domain contains approximately 300 amino acids and is monomeric. In contrast, in trimeric autotransporters, the translocator domain contains 60 to 70 amino acids and forms trimers in the outer membrane. This entry represents a Trp-ring domain which is found in the translocator region of H. influenzae Hia autotransporter, an adhesive protein that promotes adherence to respiratory epithelial cells. Trp-ring domains appear to be crucial repeated modular units in Hia, both in the general architecture of the passenger domain and in the structure of the binding domains.	50		Trimeric autotransporter adhesin Trp ring domain	Trimeric autotransporter adhesin Trp ring domain

In the Pasteurella multocida toxin (PMT) C-terminal fragment, structural analysis have indicated that the C1 domain possesses a signal that leads the toxin to the cell membrane. Furthermore, the C1 domain was found to structurally resemble the phospholipid-binding domain of C. difficile toxin B. Functional studies in Vibrio cholera indicate that the subdomain at the N-terminus of RID (Rho-inactivation domain), homologous to the membrane targeting C1 domain of Pasteurella multocida toxin, is a conserved membrane localization domain essential for proper localization. The Rho-inactivation domain (RID) of MARTX (Multifunctional Autoprocessing RTX toxin) is responsible for inactivating the Rho-family of small GTPases in Vibrio cholerae.

This family consists of a number of bacterial sequences which are highly similar to the Tir chaperone protein in E. Coli. In many Gram-negative bacteria, a key indicator of pathogenic potential is the possession of a specialized type III secretion system, which is utilized to deliver virulence effector proteins directly into the host cell cytosol. Many of the proteins secreted from such systems require small cytosolic chaperones to maintain the secreted substrates in a secretion-competent state. CesT serves a chaperone function for the enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) translocated intimin receptor (Tir) protein, which confers upon EPEC the ability to alter host cell morphology following intimate bacterial attachment. This family also contains several DspF and related sequences from several plant pathogenic bacteria. The ""disease-specific"" (dsp) region next to the hrp gene cluster of Erwinia amylovora is required for pathogenicity but not for elicitation of the hypersensitive reaction. DspF and AvrF are small (16 kDa and 14 kDa) and acidic with predicted amphipathic alpha helices in their C termini; they resemble chaperones for virulence factors secreted by type III secretion systems of animal pathogens."	119	CL0097	Tir chaperone protein (CesT) family	Type III secretory system chaperone

Conjugative transfer of a bacteriocin plasmid, pPD1, of Enterococcus faecalis is induced in response to a peptide sex pheromone, cPD1, secreted from plasmid-free recipient cells. cPD1 is taken up by a pPD1 donor cell and binds to an intracellular receptor, TraA. Once a recipient cell acquires pPD1, it starts to produce an inhibitor of cPD1, termed iPD1, which functions as a TraA antagonist and blocks self-induction in donor cells. TraA transduces the signal of cPD1 to the mating response.	120		TraA	TraA

In these systems they might function either as a releasing peptidase or toxin. In Shigella flexneri, UniProtKB:Q8VSD5, this protein is expressed from a plasmid, and delivered into the host via the type III secretion system where it deamidates the glutamine residue at position 100 in ubiquitin-activating enzyme E2, UBC13, to a glutamic acid residue. Invasion of host cells by pathogens normally invokes an acute inflammatory response through activating the TRAF6-mediated signalling pathway. UBC13 helps to activate TRAF6. Thus deamidation of UBC13 results in the dampening of the inflammatory response. The key glutaminase deamidase activity is mediated by a cys-his-glu triad, present in all members of the family.	113	CL0125	Papain fold toxin 1, glutamine deamidase	Peptidase clan CA

UDG is a highly conserved enzyme responsible for the initiation of uracil-base excision repair. UGI forms a tight non-covalent bond to UDG, completely inhibiting it from binding to DNA by inserting its beta-1 strand into the conserved DNA-binding groove of the enzyme.

Two isoforms are specifically expressed in neuroectoderm-derived tissues, but not in tumors or cancer cell lines of non-neural tissue origin. It has been shown that blasts from a subset of patients with acute leukaemia greatly overexpress eight different BAALC transcripts, resulting in five protein isoforms.

This interacting domain is involved in virus recognition. The RHIM domain is necessary for the recruitment of RIP and RIP3 by the IFN-inducible protein DNA-dependent activator of IRFs (DAI), also known as DLM-1 or Z-DNA binding protein (ZBP1). Both the RIP kinases contribute to DAI-induced NF-kappaB activation. RIP3 undergoes auto phosphorylation on binding to DAI.	46		RIP homotypic interaction motif	RIP homotypic interaction motif
03766			367646	1	1.7782506501906765e-08	Remorin_N	Remorin, N-terminal region. Remorins are plant-specific plasma membrane-associated proteins. In tobacco remorin co-purifies with lipid rafts. Most remorins have a variable, proline-rich C-half and a more conserved N-half that is predicted to form coiled coils. Consistent with this, circular dichroism studies have demonstrated that much of the protein is alpha-helical. Remorins exist in plasma membrane preparations as oligomeric structures and form filaments in vitro. The proteins can bind polyanions including the extracellular matrix component oligogalacturonic acid (OGA). In vitro, remorin in plasma membrane preparations is phosphorylated (principally on threonine residues) in the presence of OGA and thus co-purifies with a protein kinases(s). The biological functions of remorins are unknown but roles as components of the membrane/cytoskeleton are possible.	51		Remorin, N-terminal region	Remorin

12734			403822	1	1.7782506501906765e-08	CYSTM	Cysteine-rich TM module stress tolerance. The members of this family are short cysteine-rich membrane proteins that most probably dimerize together to form a transmembrane sulfhydryl-lined pore. The CYSTM module is always present at the extreme C-terminus of the protein in which it is present. Furthermore, like the yeast prototypes, the majority of the proteins also possess a proline/glutamine-rich segment upstream of the CYSTM module that is likely to form a polar, disordered head in the cytoplasm. The presence of an atypical well-conserved acidic residue at the C-terminal end of the TM helix suggests that this might interact with a positively charged moiety in the lipid head group. Consistently across the eukaryotes, the different versions of the CYSTM module appear to have roles in stress-response or stress-tolerance, and, more specifically, in resistance to deleterious substances, implying that these might be general functions of the whole family.	37		Cysteine-rich TM module stress tolerance	Cysteine-rich TM module stress tolerance

This family consists of several Hadronyche versuta (Blue mountains funnel-web spider) specific omega-atracotoxin proteins. Omega-Atracotoxin-Hv1a is an insect-specific neurotoxin whose phylogenetic specificity derives from its ability to antagonize insect, but not vertebrate, voltage-gated calcium channels. Two spatially proximal residues, Asn(27) and Arg(35), form a contiguous molecular surface that is essential for toxin activity. It has been proposed that this surface of the beta-hairpin is a key site for interaction of the toxin with insect calcium channels.	37	CL0083	Omega-atracotoxin	Omega toxin-like

18704	Tudor	Tudor domain 'Royal family'	436678	1	1.7782506501906765e-08	Chromo_2	Chromatin organization modifier domain 2. Chromodomains serve as chromatin-targeting modules, general protein interaction elements as well as dimerization sites. They are found in many chromatin-associated proteins that bind modified histone tails for chromatin targeting. Chromodomains often recognize modified lysines through their aromatic cage thus targeting proteins to chromatin. Family members such as GEN1 carry a chomodomain which directly contacts DNA and its truncation severely hampers GEN1's catalytic activity. The chromodomain allows GEN1 to correctly position itself against DNA molecules, and without the chromodomain, GEN1's ability to cut DNA was severely impaired. The GEN1 chromodomain was found to be distantly related to the CDY chromodomains and chromobox proteins, particularly to the chromo-shadow domains of CBX1, CBX3 and CBX5. Furthermore, it is conserved from yeast (Yen1) to humans with the only exception being the Caenorhabditis elegans GEN1, which has a much smaller protein size of 443 amino acids compared to yeast Yen1 (759 aa) or human GEN1 (908 aa).	62	CL0049	Chromatin organization modifier domain 2	Tudor domain 'Royal family'

The extracellular nucleation-precipitation (ENP) pathway or Type VIII secretion system (T8SS) in Gram-negative (diderm) bacteria is responsible for the secretion and assembly of prepilins for fimbiae biogenesis, the prototypical curli. Besides the T2SS that can be involved in the assembly of prototypical Type 4 pilus, the T4SS that can be involved in the biogenesis of the prototypical pilus T, the T3SS involved in the assembly of the injectisome and the T7SS involved in the formation of the prototypical Type 1 pilus, the T8SS differs in that fibre-growth occurs extracellularly. The curli, also called thin aggregative fimbriae (Tafi), are the only fimbriae dependent on the T8SS. Tafi were first identified in Salmonella spp and the controlling operon termed agf; however subsequent isolation of the homologous operon in E coli led to its being called csg. In the absence of extracellular polysaccharides Tafi appear curled, although when expressed with such polysaccharides their morphology appears as a tangled amorphous matrix. CsgF is one of three putative curli assembly factors appearing to act as a nucleator protein. Unlike eukaryotic amyloid formation, curli biogenesis is a productive pathway requiring a specific assembly machinery.	132		Type VIII secretion system (T8SS), CsgF protein	Type VIII secretion system (T8SS)

Members have an initial hydrophobic, Phe/Tyr-rich, stretch long enough to span the membrane, a highly charged region rich in Lys, a second putative transmembrane region and a second highly charged, low complexity sequence region. Some members have up to 100 residues of additional C-terminal sequence. These genes have been shown to be found in the sub-telomeric regions of both Plasmodium falciparum and P. yoelii chromosomes.	81		Malarial early transcribed membrane protein (ETRAMP)	Malarial early transcribed membrane protein (ETRAMP)

11760			432054	1	1.7782506501906765e-08	CbiG_N	Cobalamin synthesis G N-terminal. Members of this family are involved in cobalamin synthesis. Synechocystis sp. cbiH represents a fusion between cbiH and cbiG. As other multi-functional proteins involved in cobalamin biosynthesis catalyze adjacent steps in the pathway, including CysG, CobL (CbiET), CobIJ and CobA-HemD, it is therefore possible that CbiG catalyzes a reaction step adjacent to CbiH. In the anaerobic pathway such a step could be the formation of a gamma lactone, which is thought to help to mediate the anaerobic ring contraction process. Within the cobalamin synthesis pathway CbiG catalyzes the both the opening of the lactone ring and the extrusion of the two-carbon fragment of cobalt-precorrin-5A from C-20 and its associated methyl group (deacylation) to give cobalt-precorrin-5B. The N-terminal of the enzyme is conserved in this family, and the C-terminal and the mid-sections are conserved independently in other families, CbiG_C and CbiG_mid, although the distinct function of each region is unclear.	79		Cobalamin synthesis G N-terminal	Cobalamin synthesis G N-terminal

It is given the suffix _2 to distinguish it from the PulS_OutS family of pilotins from Klebsiella and Dickeya, etc. AspS is functionally equivalent and yet structurally unrelated to the pilotins found in Klebsiella and other bacteria. AspS binds to a specific targeting sequence in the Vibrio-type secretins, enhancing the kinetics of secretin assembly; homologs of AspS are found in all species of Vibrio as well those few strains of Escherichia and Shigella that have acquired a Vibrio-type T2SS. PulS is the Kelbsiella pilotin, found in PulS_OutS, pfam09691.

05697			428591	1	1.7782506501906765e-08	Trigger_N	Bacterial trigger factor protein (TF). In the E. coli cytosol, a fraction of the newly synthesized proteins requires the activity of molecular chaperones for folding to the native state. The major chaperones implicated in this folding process are the ribosome-associated Trigger Factor (TF), and the DnaK and GroEL chaperones with their respective co-chaperones. Trigger Factor is an ATP-independent chaperone and displays chaperone and peptidyl-prolyl-cis-trans-isomerase (PPIase) activities in vitro. It is composed of at least three domains, an N-terminal domain which mediates association with the large ribosomal subunit, a central substrate binding and PPIase domain with homology to FKBP proteins, and a C-terminal domain of unknown function. The positioning of TF at the peptide exit channel, together with its ability to interact with nascent chains as short as 57 residues renders TF a prime candidate for being the first chaperone that binds to the nascent polypeptide chains. This family represents the N-terminal region of the protein.	144		Bacterial trigger factor protein (TF)	Bacterial trigger factor protein (TF)

01862			426480	1	1.7782506501906765e-08	PvlArgDC	Pyruvoyl-dependent arginine decarboxylase (PvlArgDC). Methanococcus jannaschii contains homologs of most genes required for spermidine polyamine biosynthesis. Yet genomes from neither this organism nor any other euryarchaeon have orthologues of the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate- dependent ornithine or arginine decarboxylase genes, required to produce putrescine. Instead,these organisms have a new class of arginine decarboxylase (PvlArgDC) formed by the self-cleavage of a proenzyme into a 5-kDa subunit and a 12-kDa subunit that contains a reactive pyruvoyl group. Although this extremely thermostable enzyme has no significant sequence similarity to previously characterized proteins, conserved active site residues are similar to those of the pyruvoyl-dependent histidine decarboxylase enzyme, and its subunits form a similar (alpha-beta)(3) complex. homologs of PvlArgDC are found in several bacterial genomes, including those of Chlamydia spp., which have no agmatine ureohydrolase enzyme to convert agmatine (decarboxylated arginine) into putrescine. In these intracellular pathogens, PvlArgDC may function analogously to pyruvoyl-dependent histidine decarboxylase; the cells are proposed to import arginine and export agmatine, increasing the pH and affecting the host cell's metabolism. Phylogenetic analysis of Pvl- ArgDC proteins suggests that this gene has been recruited from the euryarchaeal polyamine biosynthetic pathway to function as a degradative enzyme in bacteria.	161		Pyruvoyl-dependent arginine decarboxylase (PvlArgDC)	Pyruvoyl-dependent arginine decarboxylase (PvlArgDC)

This domain is often found at the C-terminus of proteins containing DUF4213, pfam13938. The structure of UnioProtKB:B8FUJ5, Structure 3l5o, suggests that the protein has an enolase N-terminal-like fold and this Rossmann-like C-terminal domain. Structural and bioinformatic analyses reveal partial similarities to Rossmann-like methyltransferases, with residues from the enolase-like fold combining to form a unique active site that is likely to be involved in the condensation or hydrolysis of molecules implicated in the synthesis of flavins, pterins or other siderophores.

06309	P-loop_NTPase	P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase superfamily	399367	1	1.7782506501906765e-08	Torsin	Torsin. This family consists of several eukaryotic torsin proteins. Torsion dystonia is an autosomal dominant movement disorder characterized by involuntary, repetitive muscle contractions and twisted postures. The most severe early-onset form of dystonia has been linked to mutations in the human DYT1 (TOR1A) gene encoding a protein termed torsinA. While causative genetic alterations have been identified, the function of torsin proteins and the molecular mechanism underlying dystonia remain unknown. Phylogenetic analysis of the torsin protein family indicates these proteins share distant sequence similarity with the large and diverse family of (pfam00004) proteins. It has been suggested that torsins play a role in effectively managing protein folding and that possible breakdown in a neuroprotective mechanism that is, in part, mediated by torsins may be responsible for the neuronal dysfunction associated with dystonia.	120	CL0023	Torsin	P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase superfamily

This MIT domain is the microtubule interaction and trafficking of nuclear receptor-binding factor 2 - NRBF2 - in higher eukaryotes. It is a coiled-coil region at the N-terminus of pfam08961. NRBF2 plays an essential role in autophagy, the cellular pathway that degrades long-lived proteins and other cytoplasmic contents through lysosomes. NRBF2 binds Atg14L - a Beclin-binding protein - directly via the MIT domain and enhances Atg14L-linked Vps34 kinase (a class III phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase) activity and autophagy induction.	83		MIT domain of nuclear receptor-binding factor 2	MIT domain of nuclear receptor-binding factor 2
15510	Histone	Histone superfamily	434767	1	1.7782506501906765e-08	CENP-W	CENP-W protein. CENP-W is a family of vertebral kinetochore proteins that associates directly with CENP-T. CENP-W members are histone-fold proteins. The histone fold region is critical for binding to centromeric DNA. Importantly, the CENP-T-W complex does not directly associate with CENP-A, but with histone H3 in the centromere region. CENP-T and -W form a hetero-tetramer with CENP-S and -X and bind to a ~100 bp region of nucleosome-free DNA forming a nucleosome-like structure. The DNA-CENP-T-W-S-X complex is likely to be associated with histone H3-containing nucleosomes rather than with CENP-nucleosomes.	88	CL0012	CENP-W protein	Histone superfamily

06303			428878	1	1.7782506501906765e-08	MatP	MatP N-terminal domain. This family, many of whose members are YcbG, organizes the macrodomain Ter of the chromosome of bacteria such as E coli. In these bacteria, insulated macrodomains influence the segregation of sister chromatids and the mobility of chromosomal DNA. Organisation of the Terminus region (Ter) into a macrodomain relies on the presence of a 13 bp motif called matS repeated 23 times in the 800-kb-long domain. MatS sites are the main targets in the E. coli chromosome of YcbG or MatP (macrodomain Ter protein). MatP accumulates in the cell as a discrete focus that co-localizes with the Ter macrodomain. The effects of MatP inactivation reveal its role as the main organizer of the Ter macrodomain: in the absence of MatP, DNA is less compacted, the mobility of markers is increased, and segregation of the Ter macrodomain occurs early in the cell cycle. A specific organisational system is required in the Terminus region for bacterial chromosome management during the cell cycle. This entry represents the N-terminal domain of MatP.	84		MatP N-terminal domain	MatP N-terminal domain

CTNNBL is a family of eukaryotic nuclear proteins of the catenin-beta-like 1 type that contain an armadillo motif. A human nuclear protein with this domain is thought to have a role in apoptosis. The interaction of CTNNBL1 with its known partners (the Prp19-CDC5L complex and AID) is mediated by recognition of NLS (nuclear localization signal) motifs. The RNA-splicing factor Prp31 is also an interactor, with recognition also occurring through the NLS.
