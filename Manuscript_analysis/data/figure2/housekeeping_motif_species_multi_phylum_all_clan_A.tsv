IF1 contains an S1-like RNA-binding domain, which is found in a wide variety of RNA-associated proteins. Translation initiation includes a number of interrelated steps preceding the formation of the first peptide bond. In Escherichia coli, the initiation mechanism requires, in addition to mRNA, fMet-tRNA, and ribosomal subunits,  the presence of three additional proteins (initiation factors IF1, IF2, and IF3) and at least one GTP molecule. The three initiation factors influence both the kinetics and the stability of ternary complex formation. IF1 is the smallest of the three factors. IF1 enhances the rate of 70S ribosome subunit association and dissociation and the interaction of 30S ribosomal subunit with IF2 and IF3. It stimulates 30S complex formation. In addition, by binding to the A-site of the 30S ribosomal subunit, IF1 may contribute to the fidelity of the selection of the initiation site of the mRNA.	64.0

S1-like RNA-binding domains are found in a wide variety of RNA-associated proteins. IF1A is essential for translation initiation. eIF1A acts synergistically with eIF1 to mediate assembly of ribosomal initiation complexes at the initiation codon and maintain the accuracy of this process by recognizing and destabilizing aberrant preinitiation complexes from the mRNA. Without eIF1A and eIF1, 43S ribosomal preinitiation complexes can bind to the cap-proximal region, but are unable to reach the initiation codon. eIF1a also enhances the formation of 5'-terminal complexes in the presence of other translation initiation factors. This protein family is only found in eukaryotes and archaea.	77.0

Subunit c (also called subunit 9, or proteolipid) of the Fo complex of F-ATP synthase. The F-ATP synthase (also called FoF1-ATPase) consists of two structural domains: the F1 (factor one) complex containing the soluble catalytic core, and the Fo (oligomycin sensitive factor) complex containing the membrane proton channel, linked together by a central stalk and a peripheral stalk. F1 is composed of alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and epsilon subunits with a stoichiometry of 3:3:1:1:1, while Fo consists of the three subunits a, b, and c (1:2:10-14). An oligomeric ring of 10-14 c subunits (c-ring) make up the Fo rotor. The flux of protons though the ATPase channel (Fo) drives the rotation of the c-ring, which in turn is coupled to the rotation of the F1 complex gamma subunit rotor due to the permanent binding between the gamma and epsilon subunits of F1 and the c-ring of Fo. The F-ATP synthases are primarily found in the inner membranes of eukaryotic mitochondria, in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts, or in the plasma membranes of bacteria. The F-ATP synthases are the primary producers of ATP, using the proton gradient generated by oxidative phosphorylation (mitochondria) or photosynthesis (chloroplasts). Alternatively, under conditions of low driving force, ATP synthases function as ATPases, thus generating a transmembrane proton or Na(+) gradient at the expense of energy derived from ATP hydrolysis. This group also includes F-ATP synthase that has also been found in the archaea Methanosarcina acetivorans.	65.0

Subunit c of the Fo/Vo/Ao complex is the main transmembrane subunit of F-, V- or A-type family of ATP synthases with rotary motors. These ion-transporting rotary ATP synthases are composed of two linked multi-subunit complexes: the F1, V1, and A1 complexes contains three copies each of the alpha and beta subunits that form the soluble catalytic core, which is involved in ATP synthesis/hydrolysis, and the Fo, Vo, or Ao (oligomycin sensitive) complex that forms the membrane-embedded proton pore. The F-ATP synthases (also called FoF1-ATPases) are found in the inner membranes of eukaryotic mitochondria, in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts, or in the plasma membranes of bacteria. F-ATPases are the primary producers of ATP, using the proton gradient generated by oxidative phosphorylation (mitochondria) or photosynthesis (chloroplasts). Alternatively, under conditions of low driving force, ATP synthases function as ATPases, thus generating a transmembrane proton or Na(+) gradient at the expense of energy  derived from ATP hydrolysis. The A-ATP synthase (AoA1-ATPases) is exclusively found in archaea and function like F-ATP synthase. Structurally, however, the A-ATP synthase is more closely related to the V-ATP synthase (vacuolar VoV1-ATPase), which is a proton-translocating ATPase responsible for acidification of eukaryotic intracellular compartments and for ATP synthesis in archaea and some eubacteria. Collectively, F-, V-, and A-type synthases can function in both ATP synthesis and hydrolysis modes.	65.0

HPr is a central component of the bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS). The PTS catalyses the phosphorylation of sugar substrates during their translocation across the cell membrane. The phosphoryl group from phosphoenolpyruvate is transferred to HPr by enzyme I (EI). Phospho-HPr then transfers the phosphoryl group to one of several sugar-specific phosphoprotein intermediates. The conserved histidine in the N-terminus of HPr serves as an acceptor for the phosphoryl group of EI. In addition to the phosphotransferase proteins HPr and E1, this family also includes the closely related Carbon Catabolite Repressor (CCR) proteins which use the same phosphorylation mechanism and interact with transcriptional regulators to control expression of genes coding for utilization of less favored carbon sources.	77.0

CSP's are also expressed under normal condition at lower level. The function of cold-shock proteins is not fully understood. They preferentially bind poly-pyrimidine region of single-stranded RNA and DNA.  CSP's are thought to bind mRNA and regulate ribosomal translation, mRNA degradation, and  the rate of transcription termination. The human Y-box protein, which contains a CSD, regulates transcription and translation of genes that contain the Y-box sequence in their promoters. This specific ssDNA-binding properties of CSD are required for the binding of Y-box protein to the promoter's Y-box sequence, thereby regulating transcription.	65.0

L29 is a protein of the large ribosomal Subunit. A homolog, called heparin/heparan sulfate interacting protein (HIP), has also been identified in mammals.  L29 is located on the surface of the large ribosomal subunit, where it participates in forming a protein ring that surrounds the polypeptide exit channel, providing structural support for the ribosome.  L29 is involved in forming the translocon binding site, along with L19, L22, L23, L24, and L31e.  In addition, L29 and L23 form the interaction site for trigger factor (TF) on the ribosomal surface, adjacent to the exit tunnel.  L29 forms numerous interactions with L23 and with the 23S rRNA. In some eukaryotes, L29 is referred to as L35, which is distinct from L35 found in bacteria and some eukaryotes (primarily plastids and mitochondria).  The mammalian homolog, HIP, is found on the surface of many tissues and cell lines. It is believed to play a role in cell adhesion and modulation of blood coagulation. It has also been shown to inhibit apoptosis in cancer cells.	57.0

CSP's are also expressed under normal condition at lower level. The function of cold-shock proteins is not fully understood. They preferentially bind poly-pyrimidine region of single-stranded RNA and DNA.  CSP's are thought to bind mRNA and regulate ribosomal translation, mRNA degradation, and  the rate of transcription termination. The human Y-box protein, which contains a CSD, regulates transcription and translation of genes that contain the Y-box sequence in their promoters. This specific ssDNA-binding properties of CSD are required for the binding of Y-box protein to the promoter's Y-box sequence, thereby regulating transcription.	65.0

L29 is a protein of the large ribosomal Subunit. A homolog, called heparin/heparan sulfate interacting protein (HIP), has also been identified in mammals.  L29 is located on the surface of the large ribosomal subunit, where it participates in forming a protein ring that surrounds the polypeptide exit channel, providing structural support for the ribosome.  L29 is involved in forming the translocon binding site, along with L19, L22, L23, L24, and L31e.  In addition, L29 and L23 form the interaction site for trigger factor (TF) on the ribosomal surface, adjacent to the exit tunnel.  L29 forms numerous interactions with L23 and with the 23S rRNA. In some eukaryotes, L29 is referred to as L35, which is distinct from L35 found in bacteria and some eukaryotes (primarily plastids and mitochondria).  The mammalian homolog, HIP, is found on the surface of many tissues and cell lines. It is believed to play a role in cell adhesion and modulation of blood coagulation. It has also been shown to inhibit apoptosis in cancer cells.	57.0

This short domain consists of a helix-turn-helix structure, which can bind to several types of RNA. It is found in the ribosomal protein S15, the influenza A viral nonstructural protein (NSA) and in several eukaryotic aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRSs), where it occurs as a single or a repeated unit. It is involved in both protein-RNA interactions by binding tRNA and protein-protein interactions in the formation of tRNA-synthetases into multienzyme complexes. While this domain lacks significant sequence similarity between the subgroups in which it is found, they share similar electrostatic surface potentials and thus are likely to bind to RNA via the same mechanism.	46.0

IF1 contains an S1-like RNA-binding domain, which is found in a wide variety of RNA-associated proteins. Translation initiation includes a number of interrelated steps preceding the formation of the first peptide bond. In Escherichia coli, the initiation mechanism requires, in addition to mRNA, fMet-tRNA, and ribosomal subunits,  the presence of three additional proteins (initiation factors IF1, IF2, and IF3) and at least one GTP molecule. The three initiation factors influence both the kinetics and the stability of ternary complex formation. IF1 is the smallest of the three factors. IF1 enhances the rate of 70S ribosome subunit association and dissociation and the interaction of 30S ribosomal subunit with IF2 and IF3. It stimulates 30S complex formation. In addition, by binding to the A-site of the 30S ribosomal subunit, IF1 may contribute to the fidelity of the selection of the initiation site of the mRNA.	64.0

IF1A is essential for translation initiation. eIF1A acts synergistically with eIF1 to mediate assembly of ribosomal initiation complexes at the initiation codon and maintain the accuracy of this process by recognizing and destabilizing aberrant preinitiation complexes from the mRNA. Without eIF1A and eIF1, 43S ribosomal preinitiation complexes can bind to the cap-proximal region, but are unable to reach the initiation codon. eIF1a also enhances the formation of 5'-terminal complexes in the presence of other translation initiation factors.

This model recognizes a region of about 55 amino acids toward the N-terminal end of bacterial proteins of about 85 amino acids in length. The best-characterized member is prevent-host-death (phd) of bacteriophage P1, the antidote partner of death-on-curing (doc) (TIGR01550) in an addiction module. Addiction modules prevent plasmid curing by killing the host cell as the longer-lived killing protein persists while the gene for the shorter-lived antidote is lost. Note, however, that relatively few members of this family appear to be plasmid or phage-encoded. Also, there is little overlap, except for phage P1 itself, of species with this family and with the doc family.

L29 is a protein of the large ribosomal Subunit. A homolog, called heparin/heparan sulfate interacting protein (HIP), has also been identified in mammals.  L29 is located on the surface of the large ribosomal subunit, where it participates in forming a protein ring that surrounds the polypeptide exit channel, providing structural support for the ribosome.  L29 is involved in forming the translocon binding site, along with L19, L22, L23, L24, and L31e.  In addition, L29 and L23 form the interaction site for trigger factor (TF) on the ribosomal surface, adjacent to the exit tunnel.  L29 forms numerous interactions with L23 and with the 23S rRNA. In some eukaryotes, L29 is referred to as L35, which is distinct from L35 found in bacteria and some eukaryotes (primarily plastids and mitochondria).  The mammalian homolog, HIP, is found on the surface of many tissues and cell lines. It is believed to play a role in cell adhesion and modulation of blood coagulation. It has also been shown to inhibit apoptosis in cancer cells.	57.0

CrgA is a trans-membrane (TM) protein, first described in Streptomyces as being required for sporulation through the coordination of several aspects of reproductive growth. In Mtb (Mycobacterium tuberculosis ) CrgA is a central component of the divisome, and consists of 93 residues with two predicted TM helices (TM1: residues 29-51; and TM2: residues 66-88). CrgA facilitates the recruitment of the proteins essential for peptidoglycan synthesis to the divisome and also stabilizes the divisome. Reduced production of CrgA results in elongated cells and reduced growth rate, and loss of CrgA impairs peptidoglycan synthesis. CrgA has homologs in other actinomycetes.	88.0			Cell division protein CrgA

The seed alignment for this model does not include any eukaryotic sequence and is not guaranteed to find eukaryotic examples, although it does find some. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which expresses the amidotransferase for mitochondrial protein translation, seems to lack a gatC ortholog.

It is involved in both protein-RNA interactions by binding tRNA and protein-protein interactions in the formation of tRNA-synthetases into multienzyme complexes.

Bacterial micro-compartments are primitive protein-based organelles that sequester specific metabolic pathways in bacterial cells. The prototypical bacterial microcompartment is the carboxysome shell, a bacterial polyhedral organelle which increase the efficiency of CO2 fixation by encapsulating RuBisCO and carbonic anhydrase. They can be divided into two types: alpha-type carboxysomes (alpha-cyanobacteria and proteobacteria) and beta-type carboxysomes (beta-cyanobacteria).  Potential functional differences between the two types are not yet fully understood. In addition to these proteins there are several homologous shell proteins including those found in pdu organelles involved in coenzyme B12-dependent degradation of 1,2-propanediol and eut organelles involved in the cobalamin-dependent degradation of ethanolamine. Structure evidence shows that several carboxysome shell proteins and their homologs (Csos1A, CcmK1,2,4, and PduU) exist as hexamers which might further assemble into extended, tightly packed layers hypothesized to represent the flat facets of the polyhedral organelles outer shell. Although it has been suggested that other homologous proteins in this family might also form hexamers and play similar functional roles in the construction of their corresponding organelle outer shells at present no experimental evidence directly supports this view.	84.0

CSP's include the major cold-shock proteins CspA and CspB in bacteria and the eukaryotic gene regulatory factor Y-box protein. CSP expression is up-regulated by an abrupt drop in growth temperature. CSP's are also expressed under normal condition at lower level. The function of cold-shock proteins is not fully understood. They preferentially bind poly-pyrimidine region of single-stranded RNA and DNA.  CSP's are thought to bind mRNA and regulate ribosomal translation, mRNA degradation, and  the rate of transcription termination. The human Y-box protein, which contains a CSD, regulates transcription and translation of genes that contain the Y-box sequence in their promoters. This specific ssDNA-binding properties of CSD are required for the binding of Y-box protein to the promoter's Y-box sequence, thereby regulating transcription.	65.0

Ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain found in a group of small sulfide carrier proteins This family includes ThiS, MoaD, CysO, QbsE, and their homologs, which are structurally homologous to ubiquitin (Ub) and may function as the sulfide donor for the biosynthesis of thiamin, molybdopterin, cysteine, thioquinolobactin, and other sulfur-containing natural products. Ub is a protein modifier in eukaryotes that is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, cell cycle control, and DNA repair. Ubiquitination is comprised of a cascade of E1, E2 and E3 enzymes that results in a covalent bond between the C-terminus of Ub and the epsilon-amino group of a substrate lysine. Like Ub, small sulfide carrier proteins in this family are adenylated at a diglycyl C-terminus by specific activating proteins. The adenylated C-terminus is subsequently converted to a thiocarboxylate, serving as the sulfide source. Those activating proteins are diverse and show little sequence similarity. This family also includes the small archaeal modifier protein (SAMP), including SAMP1, SAMP2 and SAMP3, which are Ub-like proteins that function as protein modifiers and are required for the production of sulfur-containing biomolecules in the archaeon Haloferax volcanii. SAMP1 and SAMP2 are involved in sulfur transfer during molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis and tRNA thiolation much like MoaD and Urm1, respectively. They can form covalent conjugates with their protein targets through an isopeptide linkage via their C-terminal diglycine motif in a streamlined archaeal E1-dependent pathway. SAMP2 also forms homo-conjugates through the intermolecular isopeptide bond between the C-terminal Gly and the Lys58 side chain, a feature that likely resembles polyubiquitination. SAMP3 conjugates are dependent on the Ub-activating E1 enzyme homolog of archaea (UbaA) for synthesis and are cleaved by the JAMM/MPN+ domain metalloprotease HvJAMM1.	88.0

L29 is a protein of the large ribosomal Subunit. A homolog, called heparin/heparan sulfate interacting protein (HIP), has also been identified in mammals.  L29 is located on the surface of the large ribosomal subunit, where it participates in forming a protein ring that surrounds the polypeptide exit channel, providing structural support for the ribosome.  L29 is involved in forming the translocon binding site, along with L19, L22, L23, L24, and L31e.  In addition, L29 and L23 form the interaction site for trigger factor (TF) on the ribosomal surface, adjacent to the exit tunnel.  L29 forms numerous interactions with L23 and with the 23S rRNA. In some eukaryotes, L29 is referred to as L35, which is distinct from L35 found in bacteria and some eukaryotes (primarily plastids and mitochondria).  The mammalian homolog, HIP, is found on the surface of many tissues and cell lines. It is believed to play a role in cell adhesion and modulation of blood coagulation. It has also been shown to inhibit apoptosis in cancer cells.	57.0

Group I TRX is a small ancient protein that alter the redox state of target proteins via the reversible oxidation of an active site dithiol, present in a CXXC motif, partially exposed at the protein's surface. TRX reduces protein disulfide bonds, resulting in a disulfide bond at its active site. Oxidized TRX is converted to the active form by TRX reductase, using reducing equivalents derived from either NADPH or ferredoxins. By altering their redox state, TRX regulates the functions of at least 30 target proteins, some of which are enzymes and transcription factors. It also plays an important role in the defense against oxidative stress by directly reducing hydrogen peroxide and certain radicals, and by serving as a reductant for peroxiredoxins. At least two major types of functional TRXs have been reported in most organisms; in eukaryotes, they are located in the cytoplasm and the mitochondria. Higher plants contain more types (at least 20 TRX genes have been detected in the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana), two of which (types f amd m) are located in the same compartment, the chloroplast. Also included in the alignment are TRX-like domains which show sequence homology to TRX but do not contain the redox active CXXC motif. Group II proteins, in addition to either a redox active TRX or a TRX-like domain, also contain additional domains, which may or may not possess homology to known proteins.	93.0

The TRX domains of this family contain an insert, approximately 25 residues in length, which correspond to an extra alpha helix and a beta strand when compared with TRX. TlpA catalyzes an essential reaction in the biogenesis of cytochrome aa3, while ResA and DsbE are essential proteins in cytochrome c maturation. Also included in this family are proteins containing a TlpA-like TRX domain with domain architectures similar to E. coli DipZ protein, and the N-terminal TRX domain of PilB protein from Neisseria which acts as a disulfide reductase that can recylce methionine sulfoxide reductases.	116.0

Dyneins are molecular motors that generate force against microtubules to produce cellular movement, and are divided into two classes: axonemal and cytoplasmic. They are supramolecular complexes consisting of three protein groups classified according to size: dynein heavy, intermediate and light chains. Axonemal dyneins form two structures, the inner and outer arms, which are attached to doublet microtubules throughout the cilia and flagella. The human homolog is the sperm-specific Sptrx-2, presumed to be a  component of the human sperm axoneme architecture. Included in this group is another human protein, TRX-like protein 2, a smaller fusion protein containing one TRX and one NDPK domain, which is also associated with microtubular structures. The other members of this group are hypothetical insect proteins containing a TRX domain and outer arm dynein light chains (14 and 16kDa) of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Using standard assays, the fusion proteins have shown no TRX enzymatic activity.	102.0

The Salmonella typhimurium ScsD is a thioredoxin-like protein which confers copper tolerance to copper-sensitive mutants of E. coli. MtbDsbE has been characterized as an oxidase in vitro, catalyzing the disulfide bond formation of substrates like hirudin. The reduced form of MtbDsbE is more stable than its oxidized form, consistent with an oxidase function. This is in contrast to the function of DsbE from gram-negative bacteria which is a specific reductase of apocytochrome c.	123.0

It contains a CXXC motif in a TRX fold and shuttles the reducing potential from the membrane domain (DsbD beta) to the N-terminal periplasmic domain (DsbD alpha).  DsbD beta, a transmembrane domain comprising of eight helices, acquires its reducing potential from the cytoplasmic thioredoxin. DsbD alpha transfers the acquired reducing potential from DsbD gamma to target proteins such as the periplasmic protein disulphide isomerases, DsbC and DsbG. This flow of reducing potential from the cytoplasm through DsbD allows DsbC and DsbG to act as isomerases in the oxidizing environment of the bacterial periplasm. DsbD also transfers reducing potential from the cytoplasm to specific reductases in the periplasm which are involved in the maturation of cytochromes.	104.0

CDSP32 is a stress-inducible TRX, i.e., it acts as a TRX by reducing protein disulfides and is induced by environmental and oxidative stress conditions. It plays a critical role in plastid defense against oxidative damage, a role related to its function as a physiological electron donor to BAS1, a plastidic 2-cys peroxiredoxin. Plants lacking CDSP32 exhibit decreased photosystem II photochemical efficiencies and chlorophyll retention compared to WT controls, as well as an increased proportion of BAS1 in its overoxidized monomeric form.	103.0

HU is a conserved nucleoid-associated protein (NAP) which binds non-specifically to duplex DNA with a particular preference for targeting nicked and bent DNA. It is highly basic and contributes to chromosomal compaction and maintenance of negative supercoiling, thus often referred to as histone-like protein. HU can induce DNA bends, condense DNA in a fiber and also interact with single stranded DNA. It contains two homologous subunits, alpha and beta, typically forming homodimers (alpha-alpha and beta-beta), except in E. coli and other enterobacteria, which form heterodimers (alpha-beta). In E. coli, HU binds uniformly to the chromosome, with a preference for damaged or distorted DNA structures and can introduce negative supercoils into closed circular DNA in the presence of topoisomerase I. Anabaena HU (AHU) shows preference for A/T-rich region in the center of its DNA binding site.	86.0

This family includes integration host factor (IHF) and HU, also called type II DNA-binding proteins (DNABII), which are small dimeric proteins that specifically bind the DNA minor groove, inducing large bends in the DNA and serving as architectural factors in a variety of cellular processes such as recombination, initiation of replication/transcription and gene regulation. IHF binds DNA in a sequence specific manner while HU displays little or no sequence preference. IHF homologs are usually heterodimers, while HU homologs are typically homodimers (except HU heterodimers from E. coli and other enterobacteria). HU is highly basic and contributes to chromosomal compaction and maintenance of negative supercoiling, thus often referred to as histone-like protein. IHF is an essential cofactor in phage lambda site-specific recombination, having an architectural role during assembly of specialized nucleoprotein structures (snups). Bacillus phage SPO1-encoded transcription factor 1 (TF1) is another related type II DNA-binding protein. Like IHF, TF1 binds DNA specifically and bends DNA sharply.	85.0

This group contains proteins related to bacillus phage SPO1-encoded transcription factor 1 (TF1),  a type II DNA-binding protein related to the DNA sequence specific (IHF) and non-specific (HU) domains. Type II DNA-binding proteins bind and bend DNA as dimers. Like IHF, TF1 binds DNA specifically and bends DNA sharply.  Bacteriophage SPO1-encoded TF1 recognizes SPO1 phage DNA containing 5-(hydroxymethyl)-2'-deoxyuridine as opposed to thymine,   Related  family members includes integration host factor (IHF) and HU, also called type II DNA-binding proteins (DNABII), which are small dimeric proteins that specifically bind the DNA minor groove, inducing large bends in the DNA and serving as architectural factors in a variety of cellular processes such as recombination, initiation of replication/transcription and gene regulation. IHF binds DNA in a sequence specific manner while HU displays little or no sequence preference. IHF homologs are usually heterodimers, while HU homologs are typically homodimers (except HU heterodimers from E. coli and other enterobacteria). HU is highly basic and contributes to chromosomal compaction and maintenance of negative supercoiling, thus often referred to as histone-like protein. IHF is an essential cofactor in phage lambda site-specific recombination, having an architectural role during assembly of specialized nucleoprotein structures (snups).	87.0

This subfamily consists of the alpha subunit of integration host factor (IHF) and IHF-like domains. IHF is a nucleoid-associated protein (NAP) that binds and sharply bends many DNA targets in a sequence specific manner. It is a heterodimeric protein composed of two highly homologous subunits IHFA (IHF-alpha) and IHFB (IHF-beta). It is known to act as a transcription factor at many gene regulatory regions in E. coli. IHF is an essential cofactor in phage lambda site-specific recombination, having an architectural role during assembly of specialized nucleoprotein structures (snups). IHF is also involved in formation as well as maintenance of bacterial biofilms since it is found in complex with extracellular DNA (eDNA) within the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) matrix of many biofilms.	88.0

L29 is a protein of the large ribosomal Subunit. A homolog, called heparin/heparan sulfate interacting protein (HIP), has also been identified in mammals.  L29 is located on the surface of the large ribosomal subunit, where it participates in forming a protein ring that surrounds the polypeptide exit channel, providing structural support for the ribosome.  L29 is involved in forming the translocon binding site, along with L19, L22, L23, L24, and L31e.  In addition, L29 and L23 form the interaction site for trigger factor (TF) on the ribosomal surface, adjacent to the exit tunnel.  L29 forms numerous interactions with L23 and with the 23S rRNA. In some eukaryotes, L29 is referred to as L35, which is distinct from L35 found in bacteria and some eukaryotes (primarily plastids and mitochondria).  The mammalian homolog, HIP, is found on the surface of many tissues and cell lines. It is believed to play a role in cell adhesion and modulation of blood coagulation. It has also been shown to inhibit apoptosis in cancer cells.	57.0

CSP's include the major cold-shock proteins CspA and CspB in bacteria and the eukaryotic gene regulatory factor Y-box protein. CSP expression is up-regulated by an abrupt drop in growth temperature. CSP's are also expressed under normal condition at lower level. The function of cold-shock proteins is not fully understood. They preferentially bind poly-pyrimidine region of single-stranded RNA and DNA.  CSP's are thought to bind mRNA and regulate ribosomal translation, mRNA degradation, and  the rate of transcription termination. The human Y-box protein, which contains a CSD, regulates transcription and translation of genes that contain the Y-box sequence in their promoters. This specific ssDNA-binding properties of CSD are required for the binding of Y-box protein to the promoter's Y-box sequence, thereby regulating transcription.	65.0

This subfamily includes HU and HU-like domains. HU is a conserved nucleoid-associated protein (NAP) which binds non-specifically to duplex DNA with a particular preference for targeting nicked and bent DNA. It is highly basic and contributes to chromosomal compaction and maintenance of negative supercoiling, thus often referred to as histone-like protein. HU can induce DNA bends, condense DNA in a fiber and also interact with single stranded DNA. It contains two homologous subunits, alpha and beta, typically forming homodimers (alpha-alpha and beta-beta), except in E. coli and other enterobacteria, which form heterodimers (alpha-beta). In E. coli, HU binds uniformly to the chromosome, with a preference for damaged or distorted DNA structures and can introduce negative supercoils into closed circular DNA in the presence of topoisomerase I. Anabaena HU (AHU) shows preference for A/T-rich region in the center of its DNA binding site.	86.0

IHF is a nucleoid-associated protein (NAP) that binds and sharply bends many DNA targets in a sequence specific manner. It is a heterodimeric protein composed of two highly homologous subunits IHFA (IHF-alpha) and IHFB (IHF-beta). It is known to act as a transcription factor at many gene regulatory regions in E. coli. IHF is an essential cofactor in phage lambda site-specific recombination, having an architectural role during assembly of specialized nucleoprotein structures (snups). IHF is also involved in formation as well as maintenance of bacterial biofilms since it is found in complex with extracellular DNA (eDNA) within the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) matrix of many biofilms.	88.0

This subfamily consists of DNA-binding proteins similar to HU domains. HU is a conserved nucleoid-associated protein (NAP) which binds non-specifically to duplex DNA with a particular preference for targeting nicked and bent DNA. It is highly basic and contributes to chromosomal compaction and maintenance of negative supercoiling, thus often referred to as histone-like protein. HU can induce DNA bends, condense DNA in a fiber and also interact with single stranded DNA. It contains two homologous subunits, alpha and beta, typically forming homodimers (alpha-alpha and beta-beta), except in E. coli and other enterobacteria, which form heterodimers (alpha-beta).	94.0

The chaperonins are 'helper' molecules required for correct folding and subsequent assembly of some proteins. These are required for normal cell growth, and are stress-induced, acting to stabilise or protect disassembled polypeptides under heat-shock conditions. Type I chaperonins present in eubacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts require the concerted action of 2 proteins, chaperonin 60 (cpn60) and chaperonin 10 (cpn10). The 10 kDa chaperonin (cpn10 - or groES in bacteria) exists as a ring-shaped oligomer of between six to eight identical subunits, while the 60 kDa chaperonin (cpn60 - or groEL in bacteria) forms a structure comprising 2 stacked rings, each ring containing 7 identical subunits. These ring structures assemble by self-stimulation in the presence of Mg2+-ATP. The central cavity of the cylindrical cpn60 tetradecamer provides as isolated environment for protein folding whilst cpn-10 binds to cpn-60 and synchronizes the release of the folded protein in an Mg2+-ATP dependent manner. The binding of cpn10 to cpn60 inhibits the weak ATPase activity of cpn60.	93.0

It is found in the ribosomal protein S15, the influenza A viral nonstructural protein (NSA) and in several eukaryotic aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRSs), where it occurs as a single or a repeated unit. It is involved in both protein-RNA interactions by binding tRNA and protein-protein interactions in the formation of tRNA-synthetases into multienzyme complexes. While this domain lacks significant sequence similarity between the subgroups in which it is found, they share similar electrostatic surface potentials and thus are likely to bind to RNA via the same mechanism.	46.0

The gene symbol cspD may have been used idependently for other subfamilies of cold shock domain proteins, such as for B. subtilis CspD. These proteins typically are shorter than 70 amino acids. In E. coli, CspD is a stress response protein induced in stationary phase. This homodimer binds single-stranded DNA and appears to inhibit DNA replication.

The chaperonins are 'helper' molecules required for correct folding and subsequent assembly of some proteins. These are required for normal cell growth, and are stress-induced, acting to stabilise or protect disassembled polypeptides under heat-shock conditions. Type I chaperonins present in eubacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts require the concerted action of 2 proteins, chaperonin 60 (cpn60) and chaperonin 10 (cpn10). The 10 kDa chaperonin (cpn10 - or groES in bacteria) exists as a ring-shaped oligomer of between six to eight identical subunits, while the 60 kDa chaperonin (cpn60 - or groEL in bacteria) forms a structure comprising 2 stacked rings, each ring containing 7 identical subunits. These ring structures assemble by self-stimulation in the presence of Mg2+-ATP. The central cavity of the cylindrical cpn60 tetradecamer provides as isolated environment for protein folding whilst cpn-10 binds to cpn-60 and synchronizes the release of the folded protein in an Mg2+-ATP dependent manner. The binding of cpn10 to cpn60 inhibits the weak ATPase activity of cpn60.	93.0

This subfamily includes HU and HU-like domains. HU is a conserved nucleoid-associated protein (NAP) which binds non-specifically to duplex DNA with a particular preference for targeting nicked and bent DNA. It is highly basic and contributes to chromosomal compaction and maintenance of negative supercoiling, thus often referred to as histone-like protein. HU can induce DNA bends, condense DNA in a fiber and also interact with single stranded DNA. It contains two homologous subunits, alpha and beta, typically forming homodimers (alpha-alpha and beta-beta), except in E. coli and other enterobacteria, which form heterodimers (alpha-beta). In E. coli, HU binds uniformly to the chromosome, with a preference for damaged or distorted DNA structures and can introduce negative supercoils into closed circular DNA in the presence of topoisomerase I. Anabaena HU (AHU) shows preference for A/T-rich region in the center of its DNA binding site.	86.0

The chaperonins are 'helper' molecules required for correct folding and subsequent assembly of some proteins. These are required for normal cell growth, and are stress-induced, acting to stabilise or protect disassembled polypeptides under heat-shock conditions. Type I chaperonins present in eubacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts require the concerted action of 2 proteins, chaperonin 60 (cpn60) and chaperonin 10 (cpn10). The 10 kDa chaperonin (cpn10 - or groES in bacteria) exists as a ring-shaped oligomer of between six to eight identical subunits, while the 60 kDa chaperonin (cpn60 - or groEL in bacteria) forms a structure comprising 2 stacked rings, each ring containing 7 identical subunits. These ring structures assemble by self-stimulation in the presence of Mg2+-ATP. The central cavity of the cylindrical cpn60 tetradecamer provides as isolated environment for protein folding whilst cpn-10 binds to cpn-60 and synchronizes the release of the folded protein in an Mg2+-ATP dependent manner. The binding of cpn10 to cpn60 inhibits the weak ATPase activity of cpn60.	93.0

CSP's include the major cold-shock proteins CspA and CspB in bacteria and the eukaryotic gene regulatory factor Y-box protein. CSP expression is up-regulated by an abrupt drop in growth temperature. CSP's are also expressed under normal condition at lower level. The function of cold-shock proteins is not fully understood. They preferentially bind poly-pyrimidine region of single-stranded RNA and DNA.  CSP's are thought to bind mRNA and regulate ribosomal translation, mRNA degradation, and  the rate of transcription termination. The human Y-box protein, which contains a CSD, regulates transcription and translation of genes that contain the Y-box sequence in their promoters. This specific ssDNA-binding properties of CSD are required for the binding of Y-box protein to the promoter's Y-box sequence, thereby regulating transcription.	65.0

The gene symbol cspD may have been used idependently for other subfamilies of cold shock domain proteins, such as for B. subtilis CspD. These proteins typically are shorter than 70 amino acids. In E. coli, CspD is a stress response protein induced in stationary phase. This homodimer binds single-stranded DNA and appears to inhibit DNA replication.

This domain family contains an uncharacterized protein YrkD from Bacillus subtilis and related proteins. This family is part of a larger superfamily that contains various transcriptional regulators that respond to different stressors such as Cu(I), Ni(I), sulfite, and formaldehyde, and includes CsoRs (copper-sensitive operon repressors). CsoRs form homotetramers (dimer of dimers). In Mycobacterium tuberculosis CsoR, within each dimer, two Cys residues on opposite subunits, along with a His residue, bind the Cu(I) ion (forming a triagonal S2N coordination complex, C-H-C). These residues are conserved in the majority of members of this superfamily. In this family, however, not all these residues are conserved, there is an Asn instead of the His (C-N-C); also a conserved Tyr and a Glu residue that facilitates allosteric regulation of DNA binding for CsoRs are very poorly conserved.	82.0

This superfamily includes various transcriptional regulators that respond to stressors including Cu(I), Ni(I), sulfite, and formaldehyde. It includes CsoR (copper-sensitive operon repressor) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MtCsoR), Bacillus subtilis (BsCsoR), Thermus thermophilus (TthCsoR), and Staphylococcus aureus (SaCsoR), Mycobacterium tuberculosis RicR (regulated in copper repressor, MtRicR), Escherichia coli RncR (formally known as YohL, nickel and cobalt-sensitive), Alcaligenes xylosoxidans NreA (nickel-sensitive), E. coli FrmR (formally known as YaiN, formaldehyde sensitive), and Staphylococcus aureus CstR (CsoR-like sulfur transferase repressor, NWMN_0026.5, SaCstR). CsoR is Cu(I)-inducible, and regulates the expression of genes involved in copper homeostasis. For example, TthCsoR binds the promoter region of the copZ-csoR-copA operon, and represses expression of these genes, which encode the copper chaperone CopZ, CsoR, and the copper efflux P-type ATPase CopA, respectively. In the presence of excess Cu(I), TthCsoR binds this ion, and is released from the DNA, allowing expression of the downstream genes. TthCsoR also senses other metal ions such as Cu(II), Zn(II), Ag(I), Cd(II) and Ni(II). CsoRs form a homotetramer (dimer of dimers). In the case of MtCsoR, two Cys residues on opposite subunits within each dimer, along with a His residue, bind the Cu(I) ion. These residues are conserved in the majority of members of this superfamily. Exceptions include the functionally uncharacterized Bacillus subtilis YrkD where there is an Asn instead of His (C-N-C), E.coli RcnR where there is a Thr instead of the second Cys  (C-H-T), or TthCsoR and E.coli FrmR where there is a His instead of the second Cys and which have an additional N-terminal His (not found in those family members having C-H-C) that may also be involved in metal binding (H-C-H-H). A conserved Tyr and a Glu residue facilitate allosteric regulation of DNA binding. SaCstR regulates genes predicted to function in sulfur metabolism; it is thought that oxidation of the intersubunit Cys pair to a mixture of disulphide and trisulphide linkages by sulfite, results in a reduced affinity of SaCstR for the operator DNA. SaCstR exists as a mixture of oligomeric states, including dimers, tetramers and octamers. The sequence of SaCstR was not available at the time this hierarchy was curated and therefore was not included. Escherichia coli RncR represses expression of the gene encoding the nickel and cobalt-efflux protein RcnA.

This domain family includes various transcriptional regulators that respond to different stressors. It includes Escherichia coli RncR (formally known as YohL, nickel and cobalt-sensitive), and E. coli FrmR (formally known as YaiN, formaldehyde sensitive). Escherichia coli RncR represses expression of the gene encoding the nickel and cobalt-efflux protein RcnA; RcnA may act through modulating NikR, to repress the NIkABCDE nickel transporter. In vitro, purified RncR binds to the rncA promoter DNA fragment in the absence of Ni2+ or Co2+, and the affinity of RncR for this promoter is reduced in the presence of excess nickel.  Escherichia coli FrmR regulates the formaldehyde degradation frmRAB operon. This family belongs to a larger superfamily that includes CsoRs (copper-sensitive operon repressors). CsoRs form homotetramers (dimer of dimers). In Mycobacterium tuberculosis CsoR, within each dimer, two Cys residues on opposite subunits, along with a His residue, bind the Cu(I) ion (forming a triagonal S2N coordination complex, C-H-C). These residues are conserved in the majority of members of this superfamily. In this family, however, not all these residues are conserved; in E.coli RcnR and FrmR there is a His or a Thr instead of the second Cys (C-H-H or C-H-T) respectively. For E. coli FrmR, an N-terminal His residue, not conserved in all members of this family, is also involved in metal binding (H-C-H-H). A conserved Tyr and a Glu residue that facilitate allosteric regulation of DNA binding for CsoRs are poorly conserved in this family.	88.0

This domain family contains various Cu(I)-inducible transcriptional regulators including CsoR (copper-sensitive operon repressor) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MtCsoR), and Thermus thermophilus (TthCsoR). CsoR regulates the expression of genes involved in copper homeostasis. For example, TthCsoR binds the promoter region of the copZ-csoR-copA operon, and represses expression of these genes, which encode the copper chaperone CopZ, CsoR, and the copper efflux P-type ATPase CopA, respectively. In the presence of excess Cu(I), TthCsoR binds this ion, and is released from the DNA, allowing expression of the downstream genes. TthCsoR also senses other metal ions such as Cu(II), Zn(II), Ag(I), Cd(II) and Ni(II). MtCsoR regulates an operon that includes CsoR and a putative copper transporter gene, ctpV (cation transporter P-type ATPase). CsoRs form a homotetramer (dimer of dimers). In MtCsoR, within each dimer, two Cys residues on opposite subunits, along with a His residue, bind the Cu(I) ion (forming a triagonal S2N coordination complex, C-H-C). These residues are conserved in some but not all members of this family; for example, for TthCsoR, there is a His instead of the second Cys as well as an N-terminal His (not found in those family members having C-H-C) which  may also be involved in metal binding (H-C-H-H). A conserved Tyr and a Glu residue facilitate allosteric regulation of DNA binding.	82.0

This domain is found in AbrB from Bacillus subtilis. The product of the abrB gene is an ambiactive repressor and activator of the transcription of genes expressed during the transition state between vegetative growth and the onset of stationary phase and sporulation. AbrB is thought to interact directly with the transcription initiation regions of genes under its control. AbrB contains a helix-turn-helix structure, but this domain ends before the helix-turn-helix begins. The product of the B. subtilis gene spoVT is another member of this family and is also a transcriptional regulator. DNA-binding activity in this AbrB homologue requires hexamerisation. Another family member has been isolated from the Sulfolobus solfataricus and has been identified as a homologue of bacterial repressor-like proteins. The Escherichia coli family member SohA or Prl1F appears to be bifunctional and is able to regulate its own expression as well as relieve the export block imposed by high-level synthesis of beta-galactosidase hybrid proteins.	45.0

AbrB-like is a family of small proteins that operate in conjunction with a cognate toxin molecule. The commonly attributed role of toxin-antitoxin systems is to maintain low-copy number plasmids from one generation to the next. Such gene-pairs are also found on chromosomes and to be associated with a number of biological functions such as: reduction of protein synthesis, gene regulation and retardation of cell growth under nutritional stress. This family includes proteins from a number of different pairings, eg MazE, AbrB, VapB, PhoU, PemI-like and SpoVT. MazE is the antidote to the toxin MazF of E. coli. MazE-MazF in E. coli is a regulated prokaryotic chromosomal addiction module. MazE antidote is degraded by the ClpPA protease of the bacterial proteasome. MazE-MazF is thought to play a role in programmed cell death when cells suffer nutrient deprivation, and MazE-MazF modules have also been implicated in the bacteriostatic effects of other addiction modules.	44.0	CL0132	AbrB	Antidote-toxin recognition MazE, bacterial antitoxin

This domain model summarizes a family of DNA-binding domains unique to bacteria and represented by the Hin protein of Salmonella. The basic HTH domain is a simple fold comprised of three core helices that form a right-handed helical bundle. The principal DNA-protein interface is formed by the third helix, the recognition helix, inserting itself into the major groove of the DNA. A diverse array of HTH domains participate in a variety of functions that depend on their DNA-binding properties. HTH_Hin represents one of the simplest versions of the HTH domains; the characterization of homologous relationships between various sequence-diverse HTH domain families remains difficult. The Hin recombinase induces the site-specific inversion of a chromosomal DNA segment containing a promoter, which controls the alternate expression of two genes by reversibly switching orientation. The Hin recombinase consists of a single polypeptide chain containing a C-terminal DNA-binding domain (HTH_Hin) and a catalytic domain.	42.0

It serves as a bridging factor between the U11 and U12 snRNPs. It contains two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also known as RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains), connected by a linker that includes a proline-rich region. It binds to the U11-associated 59K protein via its RRM1 and employs the RRM2 to bind hairpin III of the U12 small nuclear RNA (snRNA).

HPr is a central component of the bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS). The PTS catalyses the phosphorylation of sugar substrates during their translocation across the cell membrane. The phosphoryl group from phosphoenolpyruvate is transferred to HPr by enzyme I (EI). Phospho-HPr then transfers the phosphoryl group to one of several sugar-specific phosphoprotein intermediates. The conserved histidine in the N-terminus of HPr serves as an acceptor for the phosphoryl group of EI. In addition to the phosphotransferase proteins HPr and E1, this family also includes the closely related Carbon Catabolite Repressor (CCR) proteins which use the same phosphorylation mechanism and interact with transcriptional regulators to control expression of genes coding for utilization of less favored carbon sources.	77.0

IF1 contains an S1-like RNA-binding domain, which is found in a wide variety of RNA-associated proteins. Translation initiation includes a number of interrelated steps preceding the formation of the first peptide bond. In Escherichia coli, the initiation mechanism requires, in addition to mRNA, fMet-tRNA, and ribosomal subunits,  the presence of three additional proteins (initiation factors IF1, IF2, and IF3) and at least one GTP molecule. The three initiation factors influence both the kinetics and the stability of ternary complex formation. IF1 is the smallest of the three factors. IF1 enhances the rate of 70S ribosome subunit association and dissociation and the interaction of 30S ribosomal subunit with IF2 and IF3. It stimulates 30S complex formation. In addition, by binding to the A-site of the 30S ribosomal subunit, IF1 may contribute to the fidelity of the selection of the initiation site of the mRNA.	64.0

IF1A is essential for translation initiation. eIF1A acts synergistically with eIF1 to mediate assembly of ribosomal initiation complexes at the initiation codon and maintain the accuracy of this process by recognizing and destabilizing aberrant preinitiation complexes from the mRNA. Without eIF1A and eIF1, 43S ribosomal preinitiation complexes can bind to the cap-proximal region, but are unable to reach the initiation codon. eIF1a also enhances the formation of 5'-terminal complexes in the presence of other translation initiation factors.

CSP's include the major cold-shock proteins CspA and CspB in bacteria and the eukaryotic gene regulatory factor Y-box protein. CSP expression is up-regulated by an abrupt drop in growth temperature. CSP's are also expressed under normal condition at lower level. The function of cold-shock proteins is not fully understood. They preferentially bind poly-pyrimidine region of single-stranded RNA and DNA.  CSP's are thought to bind mRNA and regulate ribosomal translation, mRNA degradation, and  the rate of transcription termination. The human Y-box protein, which contains a CSD, regulates transcription and translation of genes that contain the Y-box sequence in their promoters. This specific ssDNA-binding properties of CSD are required for the binding of Y-box protein to the promoter's Y-box sequence, thereby regulating transcription.	65.0

This subfamily includes HU and HU-like domains. HU is a conserved nucleoid-associated protein (NAP) which binds non-specifically to duplex DNA with a particular preference for targeting nicked and bent DNA. It is highly basic and contributes to chromosomal compaction and maintenance of negative supercoiling, thus often referred to as histone-like protein. HU can induce DNA bends, condense DNA in a fiber and also interact with single stranded DNA. It contains two homologous subunits, alpha and beta, typically forming homodimers (alpha-alpha and beta-beta), except in E. coli and other enterobacteria, which form heterodimers (alpha-beta). In E. coli, HU binds uniformly to the chromosome, with a preference for damaged or distorted DNA structures and can introduce negative supercoils into closed circular DNA in the presence of topoisomerase I. Anabaena HU (AHU) shows preference for A/T-rich region in the center of its DNA binding site.	86.0

This family includes integration host factor (IHF) and HU, also called type II DNA-binding proteins (DNABII), which are small dimeric proteins that specifically bind the DNA minor groove, inducing large bends in the DNA and serving as architectural factors in a variety of cellular processes such as recombination, initiation of replication/transcription and gene regulation. IHF binds DNA in a sequence specific manner while HU displays little or no sequence preference. IHF homologs are usually heterodimers, while HU homologs are typically homodimers (except HU heterodimers from E. coli and other enterobacteria). HU is highly basic and contributes to chromosomal compaction and maintenance of negative supercoiling, thus often referred to as histone-like protein. IHF is an essential cofactor in phage lambda site-specific recombination, having an architectural role during assembly of specialized nucleoprotein structures (snups).

CSP's include the major cold-shock proteins CspA and CspB in bacteria and the eukaryotic gene regulatory factor Y-box protein. CSP expression is up-regulated by an abrupt drop in growth temperature. CSP's are also expressed under normal condition at lower level. The function of cold-shock proteins is not fully understood. They preferentially bind poly-pyrimidine region of single-stranded RNA and DNA.  CSP's are thought to bind mRNA and regulate ribosomal translation, mRNA degradation, and  the rate of transcription termination. The human Y-box protein, which contains a CSD, regulates transcription and translation of genes that contain the Y-box sequence in their promoters. This specific ssDNA-binding properties of CSD are required for the binding of Y-box protein to the promoter's Y-box sequence, thereby regulating transcription.	65.0

IF1 contains an S1-like RNA-binding domain, which is found in a wide variety of RNA-associated proteins. Translation initiation includes a number of interrelated steps preceding the formation of the first peptide bond. In Escherichia coli, the initiation mechanism requires, in addition to mRNA, fMet-tRNA, and ribosomal subunits,  the presence of three additional proteins (initiation factors IF1, IF2, and IF3) and at least one GTP molecule. The three initiation factors influence both the kinetics and the stability of ternary complex formation. IF1 is the smallest of the three factors. IF1 enhances the rate of 70S ribosome subunit association and dissociation and the interaction of 30S ribosomal subunit with IF2 and IF3. It stimulates 30S complex formation. In addition, by binding to the A-site of the 30S ribosomal subunit, IF1 may contribute to the fidelity of the selection of the initiation site of the mRNA.	64.0

S1-like RNA-binding domains are found in a wide variety of RNA-associated proteins. IF1A is essential for translation initiation. eIF1A acts synergistically with eIF1 to mediate assembly of ribosomal initiation complexes at the initiation codon and maintain the accuracy of this process by recognizing and destabilizing aberrant preinitiation complexes from the mRNA. Without eIF1A and eIF1, 43S ribosomal preinitiation complexes can bind to the cap-proximal region, but are unable to reach the initiation codon. eIF1a also enhances the formation of 5'-terminal complexes in the presence of other translation initiation factors. This protein family is only found in eukaryotes and archaea.	77.0

The C-terminal part of mtIF2 contains the entire fMet-tRNAfmet binding site of IF-2 and is resistant to proteolysis. This C-terminal portion consists of two domains, IF2 C1 and IF2 C2.  IF2 C2 has been shown to contain all molecular determinants necessary and sufficient for the recognition and binding of fMet-tRNAfMet.

IF1 contains an S1-like RNA-binding domain, which is found in a wide variety of RNA-associated proteins. Translation initiation includes a number of interrelated steps preceding the formation of the first peptide bond. In Escherichia coli, the initiation mechanism requires, in addition to mRNA, fMet-tRNA, and ribosomal subunits,  the presence of three additional proteins (initiation factors IF1, IF2, and IF3) and at least one GTP molecule. The three initiation factors influence both the kinetics and the stability of ternary complex formation. IF1 is the smallest of the three factors. IF1 enhances the rate of 70S ribosome subunit association and dissociation and the interaction of 30S ribosomal subunit with IF2 and IF3. It stimulates 30S complex formation. In addition, by binding to the A-site of the 30S ribosomal subunit, IF1 may contribute to the fidelity of the selection of the initiation site of the mRNA.	64.0

S1-like RNA-binding domains are found in a wide variety of RNA-associated proteins. IF1A is essential for translation initiation. eIF1A acts synergistically with eIF1 to mediate assembly of ribosomal initiation complexes at the initiation codon and maintain the accuracy of this process by recognizing and destabilizing aberrant preinitiation complexes from the mRNA. Without eIF1A and eIF1, 43S ribosomal preinitiation complexes can bind to the cap-proximal region, but are unable to reach the initiation codon. eIF1a also enhances the formation of 5'-terminal complexes in the presence of other translation initiation factors. This protein family is only found in eukaryotes and archaea.	77.0

Toxin/antitoxin pairs are also found on main chromosomes, and likely represent selfish DNA. Sequences in the seed for this alignment all were found adjacent to toxin genes.

The chaperonins are 'helper' molecules required for correct folding and subsequent assembly of some proteins. These are required for normal cell growth, and are stress-induced, acting to stabilise or protect disassembled polypeptides under heat-shock conditions. Type I chaperonins present in eubacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts require the concerted action of 2 proteins, chaperonin 60 (cpn60) and chaperonin 10 (cpn10). The 10 kDa chaperonin (cpn10 - or groES in bacteria) exists as a ring-shaped oligomer of between six to eight identical subunits, while the 60 kDa chaperonin (cpn60 - or groEL in bacteria) forms a structure comprising 2 stacked rings, each ring containing 7 identical subunits. These ring structures assemble by self-stimulation in the presence of Mg2+-ATP. The central cavity of the cylindrical cpn60 tetradecamer provides as isolated environment for protein folding whilst cpn-10 binds to cpn-60 and synchronizes the release of the folded protein in an Mg2+-ATP dependent manner. The binding of cpn10 to cpn60 inhibits the weak ATPase activity of cpn60.	93.0

A SF is a dissociable subunit of RNA polymerase, it directs bacterial or plastid core RNA polymerase to specific promoter elements located upstream of transcription initiation points. The SR4 of Ec sigma70 and other essential primary SFs contact promoter sequences located 35 base-pairs upstream of the initiation point, recognizing a 6-base-pair -35 consensus TTGACA.  Sigma70 related SFs also include SFs which are dispensable for bacterial cell growth for example Ec sigmaS, SFs which activate regulons in response to a specific signal for example heat-shock Ec sigmaH, and a group of SFs which includes the extracytoplasmic function (ECF) SFs and is typified by Ec sigmaE which contains SR2 and -4 only. ECF SFs direct the transcription of genes that regulate various responses including periplasmic stress and pathogenesis.   Ec sigmaE SR4 also contacts the -35 element, but recognizes a different consensus (a 7-base-pair GGAACTT).  Plant SFs recognize sigma70 type promoters and direct transcription of the major plastid RNA polymerase, plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP).	55.0

This subfamily includes HU and HU-like domains. HU is a conserved nucleoid-associated protein (NAP) which binds non-specifically to duplex DNA with a particular preference for targeting nicked and bent DNA. It is highly basic and contributes to chromosomal compaction and maintenance of negative supercoiling, thus often referred to as histone-like protein. HU can induce DNA bends, condense DNA in a fiber and also interact with single stranded DNA. It contains two homologous subunits, alpha and beta, typically forming homodimers (alpha-alpha and beta-beta), except in E. coli and other enterobacteria, which form heterodimers (alpha-beta). In E. coli, HU binds uniformly to the chromosome, with a preference for damaged or distorted DNA structures and can introduce negative supercoils into closed circular DNA in the presence of topoisomerase I. Anabaena HU (AHU) shows preference for A/T-rich region in the center of its DNA binding site.	86.0

This family includes M. tuberculosis phosphoribosyl-ATP pyrophosphohydrolase (HisE or PRATP-PH) and its bacterial homologs. M. tuberculosis HisE is encoded by the hisE gene, which is a separate gene presenting in many bacteria and archaea but is fused to hisI in other bacteria, fungi and plants. HisE is responsible for the second step in the histidine-biosynthetic pathway. It can irreversibly hydrolyze phosphoribosyl-ATP (PRATP) to phosphoribosyl-AMP (PRAMP) and pyrophosphate. HisE dimerizes into a four alpha-helix bundle, forming two inferred PRATP active sites on the outer faces. M. tuberculosis HisE has been found to be essential for growth in vitro, thus making it a potential drug target for tuberculosis.	86.0

This family includes Escherichia coli phosphoribosyl-ATP pyrophosphohydrolase, HisIE, and its homologs from all three kingdoms of life. E. coli HisIE is encoded by the hisIE gene, which is formed by hisE gene fused to hisl. HisIE is a bifunctional enzyme responsible for the second and third steps of the histidine-biosynthesis pathway. Its N-terminal and C-terminal domains have phosphoribosyl-AMP cyclohydrolase (HisI) and phosphoribosyl-ATP pyrophosphohydrolase (HisE or PRATP-PH) activity, respectively. This family corresponds to the C-terminal domain of HisIE and includes many hisE gene encoding proteins, all of which show significant sequence similarity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis phosphoribosyl-ATP pyrophosphohydrolase (HisE or PRATP-PH). These proteins may be responsible for only the second step in the histidine-biosynthetic pathway, irreversibly hydrolyzing phosphoribosyl-ATP (PRATP) to phosphoribosyl-AMP (PRAMP) and pyrophosphate.	84.0

This group contains proteins related to bacillus phage SPO1-encoded transcription factor 1 (TF1),  a type II DNA-binding protein related to the DNA sequence specific (IHF) and non-specific (HU) domains. Type II DNA-binding proteins bind and bend DNA as dimers. Like IHF, TF1 binds DNA specifically and bends DNA sharply.  Bacteriophage SPO1-encoded TF1 recognizes SPO1 phage DNA containing 5-(hydroxymethyl)-2'-deoxyuridine as opposed to thymine,   Related  family members includes integration host factor (IHF) and HU, also called type II DNA-binding proteins (DNABII), which are small dimeric proteins that specifically bind the DNA minor groove, inducing large bends in the DNA and serving as architectural factors in a variety of cellular processes such as recombination, initiation of replication/transcription and gene regulation. IHF binds DNA in a sequence specific manner while HU displays little or no sequence preference. IHF homologs are usually heterodimers, while HU homologs are typically homodimers (except HU heterodimers from E. coli and other enterobacteria). HU is highly basic and contributes to chromosomal compaction and maintenance of negative supercoiling, thus often referred to as histone-like protein. IHF is an essential cofactor in phage lambda site-specific recombination, having an architectural role during assembly of specialized nucleoprotein structures (snups).	87.0

This subfamily includes HU and HU-like domains. HU is a conserved nucleoid-associated protein (NAP) which binds non-specifically to duplex DNA with a particular preference for targeting nicked and bent DNA. It is highly basic and contributes to chromosomal compaction and maintenance of negative supercoiling, thus often referred to as histone-like protein. HU can induce DNA bends, condense DNA in a fiber and also interact with single stranded DNA. It contains two homologous subunits, alpha and beta, typically forming homodimers (alpha-alpha and beta-beta), except in E. coli and other enterobacteria, which form heterodimers (alpha-beta). In E. coli, HU binds uniformly to the chromosome, with a preference for damaged or distorted DNA structures and can introduce negative supercoils into closed circular DNA in the presence of topoisomerase I. Anabaena HU (AHU) shows preference for A/T-rich region in the center of its DNA binding site.	86.0

Ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain found in a group of small sulfide carrier proteins This family includes ThiS, MoaD, CysO, QbsE, and their homologs, which are structurally homologous to ubiquitin (Ub) and may function as the sulfide donor for the biosynthesis of thiamin, molybdopterin, cysteine, thioquinolobactin, and other sulfur-containing natural products. Ub is a protein modifier in eukaryotes that is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, cell cycle control, and DNA repair. Ubiquitination is comprised of a cascade of E1, E2 and E3 enzymes that results in a covalent bond between the C-terminus of Ub and the epsilon-amino group of a substrate lysine. Like Ub, small sulfide carrier proteins in this family are adenylated at a diglycyl C-terminus by specific activating proteins. The adenylated C-terminus is subsequently converted to a thiocarboxylate, serving as the sulfide source. Those activating proteins are diverse and show little sequence similarity. This family also includes the small archaeal modifier protein (SAMP), including SAMP1, SAMP2 and SAMP3, which are Ub-like proteins that function as protein modifiers and are required for the production of sulfur-containing biomolecules in the archaeon Haloferax volcanii. SAMP1 and SAMP2 are involved in sulfur transfer during molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis and tRNA thiolation much like MoaD and Urm1, respectively. They can form covalent conjugates with their protein targets through an isopeptide linkage via their C-terminal diglycine motif in a streamlined archaeal E1-dependent pathway. SAMP2 also forms homo-conjugates through the intermolecular isopeptide bond between the C-terminal Gly and the Lys58 side chain, a feature that likely resembles polyubiquitination. SAMP3 conjugates are dependent on the Ub-activating E1 enzyme homolog of archaea (UbaA) for synthesis and are cleaved by the JAMM/MPN+ domain metalloprotease HvJAMM1.	88.0

This model describes MoaD. It excludes archaeal homologs, since many Archaea have two MoaD-like proteins, suggesting two different functions. pfam02597 describes both the thiamine biosynthesis protein ThiS and this protein, MoaD, a subunit (together with MoaE, pfam02391) of the molybdopterin converting factor. Both ThiS and MoaD are involved in sulfur transfer reactions. Distribution of this family appears limited to species that also have a member of pfam02391, but a number of Archaea have two different members, suggesting functionally distinct subtypes. The C-terminal Gly-Gly of this model is critical to function. [Biosynthesis of cofactors, prosthetic groups, and carriers, Molybdopterin]	80.0

The MopB domain is found in a wide variety of molybdenum- and tungsten-containing enzymes, including formate dehydrogenase-H (Fdh-H) and -N (Fdh-N), several forms of nitrate reductase (Nap, Nas, NarG), dimethylsulfoxide reductase (DMSOR), thiosulfate reductase, formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase, and arsenite oxidase. Molybdenum is present in most of these enzymes in the form of molybdopterin, a modified pterin ring with a dithiolene side chain, which is responsible for ligating the Mo. In many bacterial and archaeal species, molybdopterin is in the form of a dinucleotide, with two molybdopterin dinucleotide units per molybdenum. These proteins can function as monomers, heterodimers, or heterotrimers, depending on the protein and organism. Also included in the MopB superfamily is the eukaryotic/eubacterial protein domain family of the 75-kDa subunit/Nad11/NuoG (second domain) of respiratory complex 1/NADH-quinone oxidoreductase which is postulated to have lost an ancestral formate dehydrogenase activity and only vestigial sequence evidence remains of a molybdopterin binding site.

HPr is a central component of the bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS). The PTS catalyses the phosphorylation of sugar substrates during their translocation across the cell membrane. The phosphoryl group from phosphoenolpyruvate is transferred to HPr by enzyme I (EI). Phospho-HPr then transfers the phosphoryl group to one of several sugar-specific phosphoprotein intermediates. The conserved histidine in the N-terminus of HPr serves as an acceptor for the phosphoryl group of EI. In addition to the phosphotransferase proteins HPr and E1, this family also includes the closely related Carbon Catabolite Repressor (CCR) proteins which use the same phosphorylation mechanism and interact with transcriptional regulators to control expression of genes coding for utilization of less favored carbon sources.	77.0

It is highly basic and contributes to chromosomal compaction and maintenance of negative supercoiling, thus often referred to as histone-like protein. HU can induce DNA bends, condense DNA in a fiber and also interact with single stranded DNA. It contains two homologous subunits, alpha and beta, typically forming homodimers (alpha-alpha and beta-beta), except in E. coli and other enterobacteria, which form heterodimers (alpha-beta). In E. coli, HU binds uniformly to the chromosome, with a preference for damaged or distorted DNA structures and can introduce negative supercoils into closed circular DNA in the presence of topoisomerase I.

The phage-encoded excisionase protein (Xis) is involved in excisive recombination by regulating the assembly of the excisive intasome and by inhibiting viral integration. It adopts an unusual 'winged'-helix structure in which two alpha helices are packed against two extended strands. Also present in the structure is a two-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet, whose strands are connected by a four-residue 'wing'. During interaction with DNA, helix alpha2 is thought to insert into the major groove, while the wing contacts the adjacent minor groove or phosphodiester backbone. The C-terminal region of Xis is involved in interaction with phage-encoded integrase (Int), and a putative C-terminal alpha helix may fold upon interaction with Int and/or DNA.	72.0	CL0123	HTH	Excisionase-like protein

It is highly basic and contributes to chromosomal compaction and maintenance of negative supercoiling, thus often referred to as histone-like protein. HU can induce DNA bends, condense DNA in a fiber and also interact with single stranded DNA. It contains two homologous subunits, alpha and beta, typically forming homodimers (alpha-alpha and beta-beta), except in E. coli and other enterobacteria, which form heterodimers (alpha-beta). In E. coli, HU binds uniformly to the chromosome, with a preference for damaged or distorted DNA structures and can introduce negative supercoils into closed circular DNA in the presence of topoisomerase I. Anabaena HU (AHU) shows preference for A/T-rich region in the center of its DNA binding site.	86.0

This subfamily consists of the alpha subunit of integration host factor (IHF) and IHF-like domains. IHF is a nucleoid-associated protein (NAP) that binds and sharply bends many DNA targets in a sequence specific manner. It is a heterodimeric protein composed of two highly homologous subunits IHFA (IHF-alpha) and IHFB (IHF-beta). It is known to act as a transcription factor at many gene regulatory regions in E. coli. IHF is an essential cofactor in phage lambda site-specific recombination, having an architectural role during assembly of specialized nucleoprotein structures (snups). IHF is also involved in formation as well as maintenance of bacterial biofilms since it is found in complex with extracellular DNA (eDNA) within the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) matrix of many biofilms.	88.0

This family includes integration host factor (IHF) and HU, also called type II DNA-binding proteins (DNABII), which are small dimeric proteins that specifically bind the DNA minor groove, inducing large bends in the DNA and serving as architectural factors in a variety of cellular processes such as recombination, initiation of replication/transcription and gene regulation. IHF binds DNA in a sequence specific manner while HU displays little or no sequence preference. IHF homologs are usually heterodimers, while HU homologs are typically homodimers (except HU heterodimers from E. coli and other enterobacteria). HU is highly basic and contributes to chromosomal compaction and maintenance of negative supercoiling, thus often referred to as histone-like protein. IHF is an essential cofactor in phage lambda site-specific recombination, having an architectural role during assembly of specialized nucleoprotein structures (snups). Bacillus phage SPO1-encoded transcription factor 1 (TF1) is another related type II DNA-binding protein. Like IHF, TF1 binds DNA specifically and bends DNA sharply.	85.0

The family includes rubredoxins, a small electron transfer protein, and a slightly smaller modular rubredoxin domain present in rubrerythrin and nigerythrin and detected either N- or C-terminal to such proteins as flavin reductase, NAD(P)H-nitrite reductase, and ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase. In rubredoxin, the iron atom is coordinated by four cysteine residues (Fe(S-Cys)4), but iron can also be replaced by cobalt, nickel or zinc and believed to be involved in electron transfer.  Rubrerythrins and nigerythrins are small homodimeric proteins, generally consisting of 2 domains: a rubredoxin domain C-terminal to a non-sulfur, oxo-bridged diiron site in the N-terminal rubrerythrin domain.  Rubrerythrins and nigerythrins have putative peroxide activity.	33.0

This model recognizes a region of about 55 amino acids toward the N-terminal end of bacterial proteins of about 85 amino acids in length. The best-characterized member is prevent-host-death (phd) of bacteriophage P1, the antidote partner of death-on-curing (doc) (TIGR01550) in an addiction module. Addiction modules prevent plasmid curing by killing the host cell as the longer-lived killing protein persists while the gene for the shorter-lived antidote is lost. Note, however, that relatively few members of this family appear to be plasmid or phage-encoded. Also, there is little overlap, except for phage P1 itself, of species with this family and with the doc family.

GTPase Era, also called ERA or GTP-binding protein Era, is an essential GTPase that binds both GDP and GTP, with nucleotide exchange occurring in the order of seconds whereas hydrolysis occurs in the order of minutes. It plays a role in numerous processes, including cell cycle regulation, energy metabolism, as a chaperone for 16S rRNA processing, and 30S ribosomal subunit biogenesis. Its presence in the 30S subunit may prevent translation initiation. GTPase Era may also be critical for maintaining cell growth and cell division rates. Members of this family contain only one canonical type II K-homology (KH) domain that has the signature motif GXXG (where X represents any amino acid).	87.0

Bacterial micro-compartments are primitive protein-based organelles that sequester specific metabolic pathways in bacterial cells. The prototypical bacterial microcompartment is the carboxysome shell, a bacterial polyhedral organelle which increase the efficiency of CO2 fixation by encapsulating RuBisCO and carbonic anhydrase. They can be divided into two types: alpha-type carboxysomes (alpha-cyanobacteria and proteobacteria) and beta-type carboxysomes (beta-cyanobacteria).  Potential functional differences between the two types are not yet fully understood. In addition to these proteins there are several homologous shell proteins including those found in pdu organelles involved in coenzyme B12-dependent degradation of 1,2-propanediol and eut organelles involved in the cobalamin-dependent degradation of ethanolamine. Structure evidence shows that several carboxysome shell proteins and their homologs (Csos1A, CcmK1,2,4, and PduU) exist as hexamers which might further assemble into extended, tightly packed layers hypothesized to represent the flat facets of the polyhedral organelles outer shell. Although it has been suggested that other homologous proteins in this family might also form hexamers and play similar functional roles in the construction of their corresponding organelle outer shells at present no experimental evidence directly supports this view.	84.0

Bacterial micro-compartments are primitive protein-based organelles that sequester specific metabolic pathways in bacterial cells. The prototypical bacterial microcompartment is the carboxysome shell, a bacterial polyhedral organelle which increase the efficiency of CO2 fixation by encapsulating RuBisCO and carbonic anhydrase. They can be divided into two types: alpha-type carboxysomes (alpha-cyanobacteria and proteobacteria) and beta-type carboxysomes (beta-cyanobacteria).  In addition to these proteins there are several homologous shell proteins including those found in pdu organelles involved in coenzyme B12-dependent degradation of 1,2-propanediol and eut organelles involved in the cobalamin-dependent degradation of ethanolamine. Structure evidence shows that several carboxysome shell proteins and their homologs (Csos1A, CcmK1,2,4, and PduU) exist as hexamers which might further assemble into extended, tightly packed layers hypothesized to represent the flat facets of the polyhedral organelles outer shell. Although it has been suggested that other homologous proteins in this family might also form hexamers and play similar functional roles in the construction of their corresponding organelle outer shell at present no experimental evidence directly supports this view.	62.0

L29 is a protein of the large ribosomal Subunit. A homolog, called heparin/heparan sulfate interacting protein (HIP), has also been identified in mammals.  L29 is located on the surface of the large ribosomal subunit, where it participates in forming a protein ring that surrounds the polypeptide exit channel, providing structural support for the ribosome.  L29 is involved in forming the translocon binding site, along with L19, L22, L23, L24, and L31e.  In addition, L29 and L23 form the interaction site for trigger factor (TF) on the ribosomal surface, adjacent to the exit tunnel.  L29 forms numerous interactions with L23 and with the 23S rRNA. In some eukaryotes, L29 is referred to as L35, which is distinct from L35 found in bacteria and some eukaryotes (primarily plastids and mitochondria).  The mammalian homolog, HIP, is found on the surface of many tissues and cell lines. It is believed to play a role in cell adhesion and modulation of blood coagulation. It has also been shown to inhibit apoptosis in cancer cells.	57.0

A SF is a dissociable subunit of RNA polymerase, it directs bacterial or plastid core RNA polymerase to specific promoter elements located upstream of transcription initiation points. The SR4 of Ec sigma70 and other essential primary SFs contact promoter sequences located 35 base-pairs upstream of the initiation point, recognizing a 6-base-pair -35 consensus TTGACA.  Sigma70 related SFs also include SFs which are dispensable for bacterial cell growth for example Ec sigmaS, SFs which activate regulons in response to a specific signal for example heat-shock Ec sigmaH, and a group of SFs which includes the extracytoplasmic function (ECF) SFs and is typified by Ec sigmaE which contains SR2 and -4 only. ECF SFs direct the transcription of genes that regulate various responses including periplasmic stress and pathogenesis.

This group contains proteins related to bacillus phage SPO1-encoded transcription factor 1 (TF1),  a type II DNA-binding protein related to the DNA sequence specific (IHF) and non-specific (HU) domains. Type II DNA-binding proteins bind and bend DNA as dimers. Like IHF, TF1 binds DNA specifically and bends DNA sharply.  Bacteriophage SPO1-encoded TF1 recognizes SPO1 phage DNA containing 5-(hydroxymethyl)-2'-deoxyuridine as opposed to thymine,   Related  family members includes integration host factor (IHF) and HU, also called type II DNA-binding proteins (DNABII), which are small dimeric proteins that specifically bind the DNA minor groove, inducing large bends in the DNA and serving as architectural factors in a variety of cellular processes such as recombination, initiation of replication/transcription and gene regulation. IHF binds DNA in a sequence specific manner while HU displays little or no sequence preference. IHF homologs are usually heterodimers, while HU homologs are typically homodimers (except HU heterodimers from E. coli and other enterobacteria). HU is highly basic and contributes to chromosomal compaction and maintenance of negative supercoiling, thus often referred to as histone-like protein. IHF is an essential cofactor in phage lambda site-specific recombination, having an architectural role during assembly of specialized nucleoprotein structures (snups).	87.0

This subfamily includes HU and HU-like domains. HU is a conserved nucleoid-associated protein (NAP) which binds non-specifically to duplex DNA with a particular preference for targeting nicked and bent DNA. It is highly basic and contributes to chromosomal compaction and maintenance of negative supercoiling, thus often referred to as histone-like protein. HU can induce DNA bends, condense DNA in a fiber and also interact with single stranded DNA. It contains two homologous subunits, alpha and beta, typically forming homodimers (alpha-alpha and beta-beta), except in E. coli and other enterobacteria, which form heterodimers (alpha-beta). In E. coli, HU binds uniformly to the chromosome, with a preference for damaged or distorted DNA structures and can introduce negative supercoils into closed circular DNA in the presence of topoisomerase I. Anabaena HU (AHU) shows preference for A/T-rich region in the center of its DNA binding site.	86.0

Toxin/antitoxin pairs are also found on main chromosomes, and likely represent selfish DNA. Sequences in the seed for this alignment all are found adjacent to RelB/DinJ family antitoxin genes (TIGR02384), as are most genes found by the resulting model. StbE from Morganella morganii plasmid R485 shows typical behaviour for an addiction module toxin. It cannot be cloned without its partner (the antitoxin), whereas its partner cannot confer plasmid stability without StbE.

IF1 contains an S1-like RNA-binding domain, which is found in a wide variety of RNA-associated proteins. Translation initiation includes a number of interrelated steps preceding the formation of the first peptide bond. In Escherichia coli, the initiation mechanism requires, in addition to mRNA, fMet-tRNA, and ribosomal subunits,  the presence of three additional proteins (initiation factors IF1, IF2, and IF3) and at least one GTP molecule. The three initiation factors influence both the kinetics and the stability of ternary complex formation. IF1 is the smallest of the three factors. IF1 enhances the rate of 70S ribosome subunit association and dissociation and the interaction of 30S ribosomal subunit with IF2 and IF3. It stimulates 30S complex formation. In addition, by binding to the A-site of the 30S ribosomal subunit, IF1 may contribute to the fidelity of the selection of the initiation site of the mRNA.	64.0

S1-like RNA-binding domains are found in a wide variety of RNA-associated proteins. IF1A is essential for translation initiation. eIF1A acts synergistically with eIF1 to mediate assembly of ribosomal initiation complexes at the initiation codon and maintain the accuracy of this process by recognizing and destabilizing aberrant preinitiation complexes from the mRNA. Without eIF1A and eIF1, 43S ribosomal preinitiation complexes can bind to the cap-proximal region, but are unable to reach the initiation codon. eIF1a also enhances the formation of 5'-terminal complexes in the presence of other translation initiation factors.

This family includes the N-terminal ribbon-helix-helix (RHH) domain of Shewanella oneidensis CopA(SO), a newly identified type II antitoxin, as well as the N-terminal RHH domain of Escherichia coli PutA flavoprotein, among other similar proteins, many of which are as yet uncharacterized. CopA(SO) is a typical RHH antitoxin that includes an ordered N-terminal domain (CopA(SO)-N) and a disordered C-terminal domain (CopA(SO)-C). Biophysical investigation indicates allosteric effects of CopA(SO)-N on CopA(SO)-C; DNA binding of CopA(SO)-N appears to induce CopA(SO)-C to fold and self-associate the C-terminal domain. The multifunctional E. coli proline utilization A (PutA) flavoprotein functions as a membrane-associated proline catabolic enzyme as well as a transcriptional repressor of the proline utilization genes putA and putP. The N-terminal domain of PutA is a transcriptional regulator with an RHH fold; structure studies show that it forms a homodimer to bind one DNA duplex. This family also includes orphan antitoxin ParD2, an antitoxin component of a non-functional type II toxin-antitoxin (TA system); it does not neutralize the effect of any of the RelE or ParE toxins.	44.0

This family includes the ribbon-helix-helix (RHH) domains of transcriptional repressor CopG, nickel-responsive transcription factor NikR, several antitoxins such as Shewanella oneidensis CopA(SO), Burkholderia pseudomallei HicB, and Caulobacter crescentus ParD, and similar proteins. CopG, a homodimeric RHH protein of around 45 residues, constitutes one of the smallest natural transcriptional repressors characterized and is the prototype of a series of repressor proteins encoded by plasmids that exhibit a similar genetic structure at their leading strand initiation and control regions. It is involved in the control of plasmid copy number. NikR, which consists of the N-terminal DNA-binding RHH domain and the C-terminal metal-binding domain (MBD) with four nickel ions, regulates several genes; in Helicobacter pylori, NikR regulates the urease enzyme under extreme acidic conditions, and is involved in the intracellular physiology of nickel. Protein HicB is part of the HicAB toxin-antitoxin (TA) system, where the toxins are RNases, found in many bacteria. In Burkholderia pseudomallei, the HicAB system may play a role in disease by regulating the frequency of persister cells, while in Yersinia pestis HicB acts as an autoregulatory protein that inhibits HicA, which acts as an mRNase. In Escherichia coli, an excess of HicA has been shown to de-repress a HicB-DNA complex and restore transcription of HicB. The CopG family RHH domain, represented by this model, forms a homodimer and binds DNA.	42.0

It is involved in both protein-RNA interactions by binding tRNA and protein-protein interactions in the formation of tRNA-synthetases into multienzyme complexes. While this domain lacks significant sequence similarity between the subgroups in which it is found, they share similar electrostatic surface potentials and thus are likely to bind to RNA via the same mechanism.	46.0

This family includes the Smr (Small MutS Related) proteins, and the C-terminal region of the MutS2 protein. It has been suggested that this domain interacts with the MutS1 protein in the case of Smr proteins and with the N-terminal MutS related region of MutS2. This domain exhibits nicking endonuclease activity that might have a role in mismatch repair or genetic recombination. It shows no significant double strand cleavage or exonuclease activity. The full-length human NEDD4-binding protein 2 also has the polynucleotide kinase activity.	76.0			Smr domain

Plasmids may be maintained stably in bacterial populations through the action of addiction modules, in which a toxin and antidote are encoded in a cassette on the plasmid. In any daughter cell that lacks the plasmid, the toxin persists and is lethal after the antidote protein is depleted. Toxin/antitoxin pairs are also found on main chromosomes, and likely represent selfish DNA. Sequences in the seed for this alignment all were found adjacent to toxin genes. The resulting model appears to describe a narrower set of proteins than pfam04221, although many in the scope of this model are not obviously paired with toxin proteins. Several toxin/antitoxin pairs may occur in a single species. [Cellular processes, Toxin production and resistance, Mobile and extrachromosomal element functions, Other]	84.0

All of them encode a stable toxin and an unstable antidote. Upon loss of the plasmid, the less stable inhibitor is inactivated more rapidly than the toxin, allowing the toxin to be activated. The activation of these systems results in cell filamentation and cessation of viable cell production. It has been verified that both the stable killer and the unstable inhibitor of the systems are short polypeptides.

Type II DNA-binding proteins bind and bend DNA as dimers. Like IHF, TF1 binds DNA specifically and bends DNA sharply.  Bacteriophage SPO1-encoded TF1 recognizes SPO1 phage DNA containing 5-(hydroxymethyl)-2'-deoxyuridine as opposed to thymine,   Related  family members includes integration host factor (IHF) and HU, also called type II DNA-binding proteins (DNABII), which are small dimeric proteins that specifically bind the DNA minor groove, inducing large bends in the DNA and serving as architectural factors in a variety of cellular processes such as recombination, initiation of replication/transcription and gene regulation. IHF binds DNA in a sequence specific manner while HU displays little or no sequence preference. IHF homologs are usually heterodimers, while HU homologs are typically homodimers (except HU heterodimers from E. coli and other enterobacteria). HU is highly basic and contributes to chromosomal compaction and maintenance of negative supercoiling, thus often referred to as histone-like protein. IHF is an essential cofactor in phage lambda site-specific recombination, having an architectural role during assembly of specialized nucleoprotein structures (snups).	87.0

This subfamily includes HU and HU-like domains. HU is a conserved nucleoid-associated protein (NAP) which binds non-specifically to duplex DNA with a particular preference for targeting nicked and bent DNA. It is highly basic and contributes to chromosomal compaction and maintenance of negative supercoiling, thus often referred to as histone-like protein. HU can induce DNA bends, condense DNA in a fiber and also interact with single stranded DNA. It contains two homologous subunits, alpha and beta, typically forming homodimers (alpha-alpha and beta-beta), except in E. coli and other enterobacteria, which form heterodimers (alpha-beta). In E. coli, HU binds uniformly to the chromosome, with a preference for damaged or distorted DNA structures and can introduce negative supercoils into closed circular DNA in the presence of topoisomerase I. Anabaena HU (AHU) shows preference for A/T-rich region in the center of its DNA binding site.	86.0

A SF is a dissociable subunit of RNA polymerase, it directs bacterial or plastid core RNA polymerase to specific promoter elements located upstream of transcription initiation points. The SR4 of Ec sigma70 and other essential primary SFs contact promoter sequences located 35 base-pairs upstream of the initiation point, recognizing a 6-base-pair -35 consensus TTGACA.  Sigma70 related SFs also include SFs which are dispensable for bacterial cell growth for example Ec sigmaS, SFs which activate regulons in response to a specific signal for example heat-shock Ec sigmaH, and a group of SFs which includes the extracytoplasmic function (ECF) SFs and is typified by Ec sigmaE which contains SR2 and -4 only. ECF SFs direct the transcription of genes that regulate various responses including periplasmic stress and pathogenesis.   Ec sigmaE SR4 also contacts the -35 element, but recognizes a different consensus (a 7-base-pair GGAACTT).  Plant SFs recognize sigma70 type promoters and direct transcription of the major plastid RNA polymerase, plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP).	55.0

This family includes the ribbon-helix-helix (RHH) domains of transcriptional repressor CopG, nickel-responsive transcription factor NikR, several antitoxins such as Shewanella oneidensis CopA(SO), Burkholderia pseudomallei HicB, and Caulobacter crescentus ParD, and similar proteins. CopG, a homodimeric RHH protein of around 45 residues, constitutes one of the smallest natural transcriptional repressors characterized and is the prototype of a series of repressor proteins encoded by plasmids that exhibit a similar genetic structure at their leading strand initiation and control regions. It is involved in the control of plasmid copy number. NikR, which consists of the N-terminal DNA-binding RHH domain and the C-terminal metal-binding domain (MBD) with four nickel ions, regulates several genes; in Helicobacter pylori, NikR regulates the urease enzyme under extreme acidic conditions, and is involved in the intracellular physiology of nickel. Protein HicB is part of the HicAB toxin-antitoxin (TA) system, where the toxins are RNases, found in many bacteria. In Burkholderia pseudomallei, the HicAB system may play a role in disease by regulating the frequency of persister cells, while in Yersinia pestis HicB acts as an autoregulatory protein that inhibits HicA, which acts as an mRNase. In Escherichia coli, an excess of HicA has been shown to de-repress a HicB-DNA complex and restore transcription of HicB. The CopG family RHH domain, represented by this model, forms a homodimer and binds DNA.	42.0

This subfamily includes HU and HU-like domains. HU is a conserved nucleoid-associated protein (NAP) which binds non-specifically to duplex DNA with a particular preference for targeting nicked and bent DNA. It is highly basic and contributes to chromosomal compaction and maintenance of negative supercoiling, thus often referred to as histone-like protein. HU can induce DNA bends, condense DNA in a fiber and also interact with single stranded DNA. It contains two homologous subunits, alpha and beta, typically forming homodimers (alpha-alpha and beta-beta), except in E. coli and other enterobacteria, which form heterodimers (alpha-beta). In E. coli, HU binds uniformly to the chromosome, with a preference for damaged or distorted DNA structures and can introduce negative supercoils into closed circular DNA in the presence of topoisomerase I.

This subfamily consists of the alpha subunit of integration host factor (IHF) and IHF-like domains. IHF is a nucleoid-associated protein (NAP) that binds and sharply bends many DNA targets in a sequence specific manner. It is a heterodimeric protein composed of two highly homologous subunits IHFA (IHF-alpha) and IHFB (IHF-beta). It is known to act as a transcription factor at many gene regulatory regions in E. coli. IHF is an essential cofactor in phage lambda site-specific recombination, having an architectural role during assembly of specialized nucleoprotein structures (snups). IHF is also involved in formation as well as maintenance of bacterial biofilms since it is found in complex with extracellular DNA (eDNA) within the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) matrix of many biofilms.	88.0

This family includes integration host factor (IHF) and HU, also called type II DNA-binding proteins (DNABII), which are small dimeric proteins that specifically bind the DNA minor groove, inducing large bends in the DNA and serving as architectural factors in a variety of cellular processes such as recombination, initiation of replication/transcription and gene regulation. IHF binds DNA in a sequence specific manner while HU displays little or no sequence preference. IHF homologs are usually heterodimers, while HU homologs are typically homodimers (except HU heterodimers from E. coli and other enterobacteria). HU is highly basic and contributes to chromosomal compaction and maintenance of negative supercoiling, thus often referred to as histone-like protein. IHF is an essential cofactor in phage lambda site-specific recombination, having an architectural role during assembly of specialized nucleoprotein structures (snups).

This family consists of several bacterial MobC-like, mobilisation proteins. MobC proteins belong to the group of relaxases. Together with MobA and MobB they bind to a single cis-active site of a mobilising plasmid, the origin of transfer (oriT) region. The absence of MobC has several different effects on oriT DNA. Site- and strand-specific nicking by MobA protein is severely reduced, accounting for the lower frequency of mobilisation. The localized DNA strand separation required for this nicking is less affected, but becomes more sensitive to the level of active DNA gyrase in the cell. In addition, strand separation is not efficiently extended through the region containing the nick site. These effects suggest a model in which MobC acts as a molecular wedge for the relaxosome-induced melting of oriT DNA. The effect of MobC on strand separation may be partially complemented by the helical distortion induced by supercoiling. However, MobC extends the melted region through the nick site, thus providing the single-stranded substrate required for cleavage by MobA.	45.0	CL0057	Met_repress	Bacterial mobilisation protein (MobC)

IF1 contains an S1-like RNA-binding domain, which is found in a wide variety of RNA-associated proteins. Translation initiation includes a number of interrelated steps preceding the formation of the first peptide bond. In Escherichia coli, the initiation mechanism requires, in addition to mRNA, fMet-tRNA, and ribosomal subunits,  the presence of three additional proteins (initiation factors IF1, IF2, and IF3) and at least one GTP molecule. The three initiation factors influence both the kinetics and the stability of ternary complex formation. IF1 is the smallest of the three factors. IF1 enhances the rate of 70S ribosome subunit association and dissociation and the interaction of 30S ribosomal subunit with IF2 and IF3. It stimulates 30S complex formation. In addition, by binding to the A-site of the 30S ribosomal subunit, IF1 may contribute to the fidelity of the selection of the initiation site of the mRNA.	64.0

IF1A is essential for translation initiation. eIF1A acts synergistically with eIF1 to mediate assembly of ribosomal initiation complexes at the initiation codon and maintain the accuracy of this process by recognizing and destabilizing aberrant preinitiation complexes from the mRNA. Without eIF1A and eIF1, 43S ribosomal preinitiation complexes can bind to the cap-proximal region, but are unable to reach the initiation codon. eIF1a also enhances the formation of 5'-terminal complexes in the presence of other translation initiation factors.

Proteins in this family mostly have a truncated helix-turn-helix (HTH) MerR-like domain. They lack a portion of the C-terminal region, called Wing 2 and the long dimerization helix that is typically present in MerR-like proteins. These truncated domains are found in response regulator receiver (REC) domain proteins (i.e., CheY), cytosine-C5 specific DNA methylases, IS607 transposase-like proteins, and RacA, a bacterial protein that anchors chromosomes to cell poles.	49.0

In the absence of arabinose, the N-terminal arm of AraC binds to the DNA binding domain (pfam00165) and helps to hold the two DNA binding domains in a relative orientation that favours DNA looping. In the presence of arabinose, the arms bind over the arabinose on the dimerization domain, thus freeing the DNA-binding domains. The freed DNA-binding domains are then able to assume a conformation suitable for binding to the adjacent DNA sites that are utilized when AraC activates transcription, and hence AraC ceases looping the DNA when arabinose is added.	42.0	CL0123	HTH	Bacterial regulatory helix-turn-helix proteins, AraC family

ACT_RelA-SpoT: the ACT  domain found C-terminal of the RelA/SpoT domains. Enzymes of the Rel/Spo family enable bacteria to survive prolonged periods of nutrient limitation by controlling guanosine-3'-diphosphate-5'-(tri)diphosphate ((p)ppGpp) production and subsequent rRNA repression (stringent response). Both the synthesis of (p)ppGpp from ATP and GDP(GTP), and its hydrolysis to GDP(GTP) and pyrophosphate, are catalyzed by Rel/Spo proteins. In Escherichia coli and its close relatives, the metabolism of (p)ppGpp is governed by two homologous proteins, RelA and SpoT. The RelA protein catalyzes (p)ppGpp synthesis in a reaction requiring its binding to ribosomes bearing codon-specified uncharged tRNA. The major role of the SpoT protein is the breakdown of (p)ppGpp by a manganese-dependent (p)ppGpp pyrophosphohydrolase activity. Although the stringent response appears to be tightly regulated by these two enzymes in E. coli, a bifunctional Rel/Spo protein has been discovered in most gram-positive organisms studied so far. These bifunctional Rel/Spo homologs (rsh) appear to modulate (p)ppGpp levels through two distinct active sites that are controlled by a reciprocal regulatory mechanism ensuring inverse coupling of opposing activities. In studies with the Streptococcus equisimilis Rel/Spo homolog, the C-terminal domain appears to be involved in this reciprocal regulation of the two opposing catalytic activities present in the N-terminal domain, ensuring that both synthesis and degradation activities are not coinduced. Members of this CD belong to the superfamily of ACT regulatory domains.	71.0

Members of this CD belong to the superfamily of ACT regulatory domains. Pairs of ACT domains are commonly involved in specifically binding an amino acid or other small ligand leading to regulation of the enzyme. The ACT domain has been detected in a number of diverse proteins; some of these proteins are involved in amino acid and purine biosynthesis, phenylalanine hydroxylation, regulation of bacterial metabolism and transcription, and many remain to be characterized. ACT domain-containing enzymes involved in amino acid and purine synthesis are in many cases allosteric enzymes with complex regulation enforced by the binding of ligands. The ACT domain is commonly involved in the binding of a small regulatory molecule, such as the amino acids L-Ser and L-Phe in the case of D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase and the bifunctional chorismate mutase-prephenate dehydratase enzyme (P-protein), respectively. Aspartokinases typically consist of two C-terminal ACT domains in a tandem repeat, but  the second ACT domain is inserted within the first, resulting in, what is normally the terminal beta strand of ACT2, formed from a region N-terminal of ACT1. ACT domain repeats have been shown to have nonequivalent ligand-binding sites with complex regulatory patterns such as those seen in the bifunctional enzyme, aspartokinase-homoserine dehydrogenase (ThrA). In other enzymes, such as phenylalanine hydroxylases, the ACT domain appears to function as a flexible small module providing allosteric regulation via transmission of conformational changes, these conformational changes are not necessarily initiated by regulatory ligand binding at the ACT domain itself. ACT domains are present either singularly, N- or C-terminal, or in pairs present C-terminal or between two catalytic domains. Unique to cyanobacteria are four ACT domains C-terminal to an aspartokinase domain. A few proteins are composed almost entirely of ACT domain repeats as seen in the four ACT domain protein, the ACR protein, found in higher plants; and the two ACT domain protein, the glycine cleavage system transcriptional repressor (GcvR) protein, found in some bacteria. Also seen are single ACT domain proteins similar to the Streptococcus pneumoniae ACT domain protein (uncharacterized pdb structure 1ZPV) found in both bacteria and archaea. Purportedly, the ACT domain is an evolutionarily mobile ligand binding regulatory module that has been fused to different enzymes at various times.	60.0

ACT_3PGDH-like: The ACT_3PGDH-like CD includes the C-terminal ACT (regulatory) domain of D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (3PGDH), with or without an extended C-terminal (xct) region found in various bacteria, archaea, fungi, and plants. 3PGDH is an enzyme that belongs to the D-isomer specific, 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase family and catalyzes the oxidation of D-3-phosphoglycerate to 3- phosphohydroxypyruvate, which is the first step in the biosynthesis of L-serine, using NAD+ as the oxidizing agent. In bacteria, 3PGDH is feedback controlled by the end product L-serine in an allosteric manner. In the Escherichia coli homotetrameric enzyme, the interface at adjacent ACT (regulatory) domains couples to create an extended beta-sheet. Each regulatory interface forms two serine-binding sites. The mechanism by which serine transmits inhibition to the active site is postulated to involve the tethering of the regulatory domains together to create a rigid quaternary structure with a solvent-exposed active site cleft. This CD also includes the C-terminal ACT domain of the L-serine dehydratase (LSD), iron-sulfur-dependent, beta subunit, found in various bacterial anaerobes such as Clostridium, Bacillus, and Treponema species. LSD enzymes catalyze the deamination of L-serine, producing pyruvate and ammonia. Unlike the eukaryotic L-serine dehydratase, which requires the pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) cofactor, the prokaryotic L-serine dehydratase contains an [4Fe-4S] cluster instead of a PLP active site. The LSD alpha and beta subunits of the 'clostridial' enzyme are encoded by the sdhA and sdhB genes. The single subunit bacterial homologs of L-serine dehydratase (LSD1, LSD2, TdcG) present in E. coli, and other Enterobacteriales, lack the ACT domain described here. Members of this CD belong to the superfamily of ACT regulatory domains.	71.0

This domain is found in AbrB from Bacillus subtilis. The product of the abrB gene is an ambiactive repressor and activator of the transcription of genes expressed during the transition state between vegetative growth and the onset of stationary phase and sporulation. AbrB is thought to interact directly with the transcription initiation regions of genes under its control. AbrB contains a helix-turn-helix structure, but this domain ends before the helix-turn-helix begins. The product of the B. subtilis gene spoVT is another member of this family and is also a transcriptional regulator. DNA-binding activity in this AbrB homologue requires hexamerisation. Another family member has been isolated from the Sulfolobus solfataricus and has been identified as a homologue of bacterial repressor-like proteins. The Escherichia coli family member SohA or Prl1F appears to be bifunctional and is able to regulate its own expression as well as relieve the export block imposed by high-level synthesis of beta-galactosidase hybrid proteins.	45.0

AbrB-like is a family of small proteins that operate in conjunction with a cognate toxin molecule. The commonly attributed role of toxin-antitoxin systems is to maintain low-copy number plasmids from one generation to the next. Such gene-pairs are also found on chromosomes and to be associated with a number of biological functions such as: reduction of protein synthesis, gene regulation and retardation of cell growth under nutritional stress. This family includes proteins from a number of different pairings, eg MazE, AbrB, VapB, PhoU, PemI-like and SpoVT. MazE is the antidote to the toxin MazF of E. coli. MazE-MazF in E. coli is a regulated prokaryotic chromosomal addiction module. MazE antidote is degraded by the ClpPA protease of the bacterial proteasome. MazE-MazF is thought to play a role in programmed cell death when cells suffer nutrient deprivation, and MazE-MazF modules have also been implicated in the bacteriostatic effects of other addiction modules.	44.0	CL0132	AbrB	Antidote-toxin recognition MazE, bacterial antitoxin

Addiction modules prevent plasmid curing by killing the host cell as the longer-lived killing protein persists while the gene for the shorter-lived antidote is lost. Note, however, that relatively few members of this family appear to be plasmid or phage-encoded. Also, there is little overlap, except for phage P1 itself, of species with this family and with the doc family.

HPr is a central component of the bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS). The PTS catalyses the phosphorylation of sugar substrates during their translocation across the cell membrane. The phosphoryl group from phosphoenolpyruvate is transferred to HPr by enzyme I (EI). Phospho-HPr then transfers the phosphoryl group to one of several sugar-specific phosphoprotein intermediates. The conserved histidine in the N-terminus of HPr serves as an acceptor for the phosphoryl group of EI. In addition to the phosphotransferase proteins HPr and E1, this family also includes the closely related Carbon Catabolite Repressor (CCR) proteins which use the same phosphorylation mechanism and interact with transcriptional regulators to control expression of genes coding for utilization of less favored carbon sources.	77.0

Plasmids may be maintained stably in bacterial populations through the action of addiction modules, in which a toxin and antidote are encoded in a cassette on the plasmid. In any daughter cell that lacks the plasmid, the toxin persists and is lethal after the antidote protein is depleted. Toxin/antitoxin pairs are also found on main chromosomes, and likely represent selfish DNA. Sequences in the seed for this alignment all are found adjacent to RelB/DinJ family antitoxin genes (TIGR02384), as are most genes found by the resulting model. StbE from Morganella morganii plasmid R485 shows typical behaviour for an addiction module toxin. It cannot be cloned without its partner (the antitoxin), whereas its partner cannot confer plasmid stability without StbE.

Group I TRX is a small ancient protein that alter the redox state of target proteins via the reversible oxidation of an active site dithiol, present in a CXXC motif, partially exposed at the protein's surface. TRX reduces protein disulfide bonds, resulting in a disulfide bond at its active site. Oxidized TRX is converted to the active form by TRX reductase, using reducing equivalents derived from either NADPH or ferredoxins. By altering their redox state, TRX regulates the functions of at least 30 target proteins, some of which are enzymes and transcription factors. It also plays an important role in the defense against oxidative stress by directly reducing hydrogen peroxide and certain radicals, and by serving as a reductant for peroxiredoxins. At least two major types of functional TRXs have been reported in most organisms; in eukaryotes, they are located in the cytoplasm and the mitochondria. Higher plants contain more types (at least 20 TRX genes have been detected in the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana), two of which (types f amd m) are located in the same compartment, the chloroplast. Also included in the alignment are TRX-like domains which show sequence homology to TRX but do not contain the redox active CXXC motif. Group II proteins, in addition to either a redox active TRX or a TRX-like domain, also contain additional domains, which may or may not possess homology to known proteins.	93.0

TlpA, ResA and DsbE are bacterial protein disulfide reductases with important roles in cytochrome maturation. They are membrane-anchored proteins with a soluble TRX domain containing a CXXC motif located in the periplasm. The TRX domains of this family contain an insert, approximately 25 residues in length, which correspond to an extra alpha helix and a beta strand when compared with TRX. TlpA catalyzes an essential reaction in the biogenesis of cytochrome aa3, while ResA and DsbE are essential proteins in cytochrome c maturation. Also included in this family are proteins containing a TlpA-like TRX domain with domain architectures similar to E. coli DipZ protein, and the N-terminal TRX domain of PilB protein from Neisseria which acts as a disulfide reductase that can recylce methionine sulfoxide reductases.	116.0

It contains a CXXC motif in a TRX fold and shuttles the reducing potential from the membrane domain (DsbD beta) to the N-terminal periplasmic domain (DsbD alpha).  DsbD beta, a transmembrane domain comprising of eight helices, acquires its reducing potential from the cytoplasmic thioredoxin. DsbD alpha transfers the acquired reducing potential from DsbD gamma to target proteins such as the periplasmic protein disulphide isomerases, DsbC and DsbG. This flow of reducing potential from the cytoplasm through DsbD allows DsbC and DsbG to act as isomerases in the oxidizing environment of the bacterial periplasm. DsbD also transfers reducing potential from the cytoplasm to specific reductases in the periplasm which are involved in the maturation of cytochromes.	104.0

Yeast complementation studies show that ERp46 can substitute for protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) function in vivo. It has been detected in many tissues, however, transcript and protein levels do not correlate in all tissues, suggesting regulation at a posttranscriptional level. An identical protein, named endoPDI, has been identified as an endothelial PDI that is highly expressed in the endothelium of tumors and hypoxic lesions. It has a protective effect on cells exposed to hypoxia.	102.0

The PDO members of this superfamily include TRX, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), tlpA-like, glutaredoxin, NrdH redoxin, and the bacterial Dsb (DsbA, DsbC, DsbG, DsbE, DsbDgamma) protein families. Members of the superfamily that do not function as PDOs but contain a TRX-fold domain include phosducins, peroxiredoxins and glutathione (GSH) peroxidases, SCO proteins, GSH transferases (GST, N-terminal domain), arsenic reductases, TRX-like ferredoxins and calsequestrin, among others.	69.0

The Salmonella typhimurium ScsD is a thioredoxin-like protein which confers copper tolerance to copper-sensitive mutants of E. coli. MtbDsbE has been characterized as an oxidase in vitro, catalyzing the disulfide bond formation of substrates like hirudin. The reduced form of MtbDsbE is more stable than its oxidized form, consistent with an oxidase function. This is in contrast to the function of DsbE from gram-negative bacteria which is a specific reductase of apocytochrome c.	123.0

Dyneins are molecular motors that generate force against microtubules to produce cellular movement, and are divided into two classes: axonemal and cytoplasmic. They are supramolecular complexes consisting of three protein groups classified according to size: dynein heavy, intermediate and light chains. Axonemal dyneins form two structures, the inner and outer arms, which are attached to doublet microtubules throughout the cilia and flagella. The human homolog is the sperm-specific Sptrx-2, presumed to be a  component of the human sperm axoneme architecture. Included in this group is another human protein, TRX-like protein 2, a smaller fusion protein containing one TRX and one NDPK domain, which is also associated with microtubular structures. The other members of this group are hypothetical insect proteins containing a TRX domain and outer arm dynein light chains (14 and 16kDa) of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Using standard assays, the fusion proteins have shown no TRX enzymatic activity.	102.0

IF1 contains an S1-like RNA-binding domain, which is found in a wide variety of RNA-associated proteins. Translation initiation includes a number of interrelated steps preceding the formation of the first peptide bond. In Escherichia coli, the initiation mechanism requires, in addition to mRNA, fMet-tRNA, and ribosomal subunits,  the presence of three additional proteins (initiation factors IF1, IF2, and IF3) and at least one GTP molecule. The three initiation factors influence both the kinetics and the stability of ternary complex formation. IF1 is the smallest of the three factors. IF1 enhances the rate of 70S ribosome subunit association and dissociation and the interaction of 30S ribosomal subunit with IF2 and IF3. It stimulates 30S complex formation. In addition, by binding to the A-site of the 30S ribosomal subunit, IF1 may contribute to the fidelity of the selection of the initiation site of the mRNA.	64.0

This superfamily includes various transcriptional regulators that respond to stressors including Cu(I), Ni(I), sulfite, and formaldehyde. It includes CsoR (copper-sensitive operon repressor) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MtCsoR), Bacillus subtilis (BsCsoR), Thermus thermophilus (TthCsoR), and Staphylococcus aureus (SaCsoR), Mycobacterium tuberculosis RicR (regulated in copper repressor, MtRicR), Escherichia coli RncR (formally known as YohL, nickel and cobalt-sensitive), Alcaligenes xylosoxidans NreA (nickel-sensitive), E. coli FrmR (formally known as YaiN, formaldehyde sensitive), and Staphylococcus aureus CstR (CsoR-like sulfur transferase repressor, NWMN_0026.5, SaCstR). CsoR is Cu(I)-inducible, and regulates the expression of genes involved in copper homeostasis. For example, TthCsoR binds the promoter region of the copZ-csoR-copA operon, and represses expression of these genes, which encode the copper chaperone CopZ, CsoR, and the copper efflux P-type ATPase CopA, respectively. In the presence of excess Cu(I), TthCsoR binds this ion, and is released from the DNA, allowing expression of the downstream genes. TthCsoR also senses other metal ions such as Cu(II), Zn(II), Ag(I), Cd(II) and Ni(II). CsoRs form a homotetramer (dimer of dimers). In the case of MtCsoR, two Cys residues on opposite subunits within each dimer, along with a His residue, bind the Cu(I) ion. These residues are conserved in the majority of members of this superfamily. Exceptions include the functionally uncharacterized Bacillus subtilis YrkD where there is an Asn instead of His (C-N-C), E.coli RcnR where there is a Thr instead of the second Cys  (C-H-T), or TthCsoR and E.coli FrmR where there is a His instead of the second Cys and which have an additional N-terminal His (not found in those family members having C-H-C) that may also be involved in metal binding (H-C-H-H). A conserved Tyr and a Glu residue facilitate allosteric regulation of DNA binding. SaCstR regulates genes predicted to function in sulfur metabolism; it is thought that oxidation of the intersubunit Cys pair to a mixture of disulphide and trisulphide linkages by sulfite, results in a reduced affinity of SaCstR for the operator DNA. SaCstR exists as a mixture of oligomeric states, including dimers, tetramers and octamers. The sequence of SaCstR was not available at the time this hierarchy was curated and therefore was not included. Escherichia coli RncR represses expression of the gene encoding the nickel and cobalt-efflux protein RcnA. The gene encoding Alcaligenes xylosoxidans NreA is part of the nre nickel resistance locus located on the pTOM9 plasmid from thisbacteria. Escherichia coli FrmR regulates the formaldehyde degradation frmRAB operon.	80.0

In Mycobacterium tuberculosis CsoR, within each dimer, two Cys residues on opposite subunits, along with a His residue, bind the Cu(I) ion (forming a triagonal S2N coordination complex, C-H-C). These residues are conserved in the majority of members of this superfamily. In this family, however, not all these residues are conserved, there is an Asn instead of the His (C-N-C); also a conserved Tyr and a Glu residue that facilitates allosteric regulation of DNA binding for CsoRs are very poorly conserved.	82.0

This domain family includes Alcaligenes xylosoxidans NreA, Psudomonas putida MreA, and related domains. The gene encoding Alcaligenes xylosoxidans NreA is part of the nre nickel resistance locus located on the pTOM9 plasmid from this bacteria; it confers low-level nickel resistance on both Ralstonia and Escherichia coli strains. The Pseudomonas putida MreA gene is found in association with a gene encoding mrdH, a heavy metal efflux transporter of broad specificity. MreA may have a role in cadmium and nickel resistance.

The phage-encoded excisionase protein Tn916-Xis adopts a winged-helix structure that consists of a three-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet that packs against a helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif and a third C-terminal alpha-helix. It is encoded for by Tn916, which also codes for the integrase Tn916-Int. The protein interacts with DNA by the insertion of helix alpha-2 into the major groove and the contact of the hairpin that connects strands beta-2 and beta-3 with the adjacent phosphodiester backbone and/or minor groove. Tn916-Xis stimulates phage excision and inhibits viral integration by stabilizing distorted DNA structures.	62.0	CL0123	HTH	Excisionase from transposon Tn916

L29 is a protein of the large ribosomal Subunit. A homolog, called heparin/heparan sulfate interacting protein (HIP), has also been identified in mammals.  L29 is located on the surface of the large ribosomal subunit, where it participates in forming a protein ring that surrounds the polypeptide exit channel, providing structural support for the ribosome.  L29 is involved in forming the translocon binding site, along with L19, L22, L23, L24, and L31e.  In addition, L29 and L23 form the interaction site for trigger factor (TF) on the ribosomal surface, adjacent to the exit tunnel.  L29 forms numerous interactions with L23 and with the 23S rRNA. In some eukaryotes, L29 is referred to as L35, which is distinct from L35 found in bacteria and some eukaryotes (primarily plastids and mitochondria).  The mammalian homolog, HIP, is found on the surface of many tissues and cell lines. It is believed to play a role in cell adhesion and modulation of blood coagulation. It has also been shown to inhibit apoptosis in cancer cells.	57.0

AbrB-like is a family of small proteins that operate in conjunction with a cognate toxin molecule. The commonly attributed role of toxin-antitoxin systems is to maintain low-copy number plasmids from one generation to the next. Such gene-pairs are also found on chromosomes and to be associated with a number of biological functions such as: reduction of protein synthesis, gene regulation and retardation of cell growth under nutritional stress. This family includes proteins from a number of different pairings, eg MazE, AbrB, VapB, PhoU, PemI-like and SpoVT. MazE is the antidote to the toxin MazF of E. coli. MazE-MazF in E. coli is a regulated prokaryotic chromosomal addiction module. MazE antidote is degraded by the ClpPA protease of the bacterial proteasome. MazE-MazF is thought to play a role in programmed cell death when cells suffer nutrient deprivation, and MazE-MazF modules have also been implicated in the bacteriostatic effects of other addiction modules.	44.0	CL0132	AbrB	Antidote-toxin recognition MazE, bacterial antitoxin

This domain model summarizes a family of DNA-binding domains unique to bacteria and represented by the Hin protein of Salmonella. The basic HTH domain is a simple fold comprised of three core helices that form a right-handed helical bundle. The principal DNA-protein interface is formed by the third helix, the recognition helix, inserting itself into the major groove of the DNA. A diverse array of HTH domains participate in a variety of functions that depend on their DNA-binding properties. HTH_Hin represents one of the simplest versions of the HTH domains; the characterization of homologous relationships between various sequence-diverse HTH domain families remains difficult. The Hin recombinase induces the site-specific inversion of a chromosomal DNA segment containing a promoter, which controls the alternate expression of two genes by reversibly switching orientation. The Hin recombinase consists of a single polypeptide chain containing a C-terminal DNA-binding domain (HTH_Hin) and a catalytic domain.	42.0

CopG, a homodimeric protein of around 45 residues, constitutes one of the smallest natural transcriptional repressors characterized and is the prototype of a series of repressor proteins encoded by plasmids that exhibit a similar genetic structure at their leading strand initiation and control regions. It binds to and represses the single Pcr promoter that directs the synthesis of a bicistronic mRNA for CopG and the RepB initiator of replication, thereby regulating its own synthesis and that of RepB.	45.0

This domain contains a helix-turn-helix motif and binds DNA. Proteins belonging to this group are response regulators; some act as transcriptional activators, others as transcriptional repressors. Many are active as homodimers. Many are two domain proteins in which the DNA binding property of the C-terminal DNA binding domain is modulated by modifications of the N-terminal domain.  For example in the case of Lux R which participates in the regulation of gene expression in response to fluctuations in cell-population density (quorum-sensing), a signaling molecule, the pheromone Acyl HSL (N-acyl derivatives of homoserine lactone), binds to the N-terminal domain and leads to LuxR dimerization.  For others phophorylation of the N-terminal domain leads to multimerization, for example Escherichia coli NarL and Sinorhizobium melilot FixJ. NarL controls gene expression of many respiratory-related operons when environmental nitrate or nitrite is present under anerobic conditions. FixJ is involved in the transcriptional activation of nitrogen fixation genes. The group also includes small proteins which lack an N-terminal signaling domain, such as Bacillus subtilis GerE.  GerE is dimeric and acts in conjunction with sigmaK as an activator or a repressor modulating the expression of various genes in particular those encoding the spore-coat. These LuxR family regulators may share a similar organization of their target binding sites. For example the LuxR dimer binds the lux box, a 20bp inverted repeat, GerE dimers bind two 12bp consensus sequences in inverted orientation having the central four bases overlap, and the NarL dimer binds two 7bp inverted repeats separated by 2 bp.	57.0

This family of short proteins includes DNA-damage-inducible protein I (DinI) and related proteins. The SOS response, a set of cellular phenomena exhibited by eubacteria, is initiated by various causes that include DNA damage-induced replication arrest, and is positively regulated by the co- protease activity of RecA. Escherichia coli DinI, a LexA-regulated SOS gene product, shuts off the initiation of the SOS response when overexpressed in vivo. Biochemical and genetic studies indicated that DinI physically interacts with RecA to inhibit its co-protease activity. The structure of DinI is known.	63.0			DinI-like family

Bacteria and some eukaryotes use two-component signal transduction systems to detect and respond to changes in the environment. The systems consists of a sensor histidine kinase and a response regulator. The former autophosphorylates a histidine residue on detecting an external stimulus. The phosphate is then transferred to an invariant aspartate residue in a highly conserved receiver domain of the response regulator. Phosphorylation activates a variable effector domain of the response regulator, which triggers the cellular response. This C-terminal effector domain belongs to the winged helix-turn-helix family of transcriptional regulators and contains DNA and RNA polymerase binding sites. Several dimers or monomers bind head to tail to small tandem repeats upstream of the genes. The RNA polymerase binding sites interact with the alpha or sigma subunit of RNA polymerase.	89.0

This family contains the C-terminal domain of proteins of unknown function (UPF0040), implicated in a cellular function of bacterial cell division. It includes protein MraZ which is present in almost all bacteria and appears to be essential for survival. It is found in gene clusters associated with the cellular function of cell division and cell wall biosynthesis, including mraW, ftsI, murE, murF, ftsW and murG. Members of this family contain two tandem copies of the domain; the crystal structure of a member of this family (MPN314) reveals that the two subdomains are related by a pseudo two-fold axis, with each subdomain containing a highly conserved DXXXR sequence motif in close proximity to each other, suggested to form the functional site.	62.0

This domain is involved in binding peptidoglycan. Two tandem repeats fold into a pseudo-2-fold symmetric single-domain structure containing numerous contacts between the repeats. FtsN is an essential cell division protein with a simple bitopic topology, a short N-terminal cytoplasmic segment fused to a large carboxy periplasmic domain through a single transmembrane domain. These repeats lay at the periplasmic C-terminus. FtsN localizes to the septum ring complex.	76.0			SPOR domain

CSP's include the major cold-shock proteins CspA and CspB in bacteria and the eukaryotic gene regulatory factor Y-box protein. CSP expression is up-regulated by an abrupt drop in growth temperature. CSP's are also expressed under normal condition at lower level. The function of cold-shock proteins is not fully understood. They preferentially bind poly-pyrimidine region of single-stranded RNA and DNA.  CSP's are thought to bind mRNA and regulate ribosomal translation, mRNA degradation, and  the rate of transcription termination. The human Y-box protein, which contains a CSD, regulates transcription and translation of genes that contain the Y-box sequence in their promoters. This specific ssDNA-binding properties of CSD are required for the binding of Y-box protein to the promoter's Y-box sequence, thereby regulating transcription.	65.0

IF1 contains an S1-like RNA-binding domain, which is found in a wide variety of RNA-associated proteins. Translation initiation includes a number of interrelated steps preceding the formation of the first peptide bond. In Escherichia coli, the initiation mechanism requires, in addition to mRNA, fMet-tRNA, and ribosomal subunits,  the presence of three additional proteins (initiation factors IF1, IF2, and IF3) and at least one GTP molecule. The three initiation factors influence both the kinetics and the stability of ternary complex formation. IF1 is the smallest of the three factors. IF1 enhances the rate of 70S ribosome subunit association and dissociation and the interaction of 30S ribosomal subunit with IF2 and IF3. It stimulates 30S complex formation. In addition, by binding to the A-site of the 30S ribosomal subunit, IF1 may contribute to the fidelity of the selection of the initiation site of the mRNA.	64.0

S1-like RNA-binding domains are found in a wide variety of RNA-associated proteins. IF1A is essential for translation initiation. eIF1A acts synergistically with eIF1 to mediate assembly of ribosomal initiation complexes at the initiation codon and maintain the accuracy of this process by recognizing and destabilizing aberrant preinitiation complexes from the mRNA. Without eIF1A and eIF1, 43S ribosomal preinitiation complexes can bind to the cap-proximal region, but are unable to reach the initiation codon. eIF1a also enhances the formation of 5'-terminal complexes in the presence of other translation initiation factors.

The small subunits of bacterial and eukaryotic ribosomes have the same overall shapes (with structural elements described as head, body, platform, beak and shoulder). Mitochondrial and chloroplastic ribosomes synthesize proteins that are involved in oxidative phosphorylation (ATP generation) and photosynthesis. bS6_MRPS6 is one of the fourteen mitochondrial ribosomal proteins that is  known to have significant sequence homology with their bacterial counterpart.	95.0

A SF is a dissociable subunit of RNA polymerase, it directs bacterial or plastid core RNA polymerase to specific promoter elements located upstream of transcription initiation points. The SR4 of Ec sigma70 and other essential primary SFs contact promoter sequences located 35 base-pairs upstream of the initiation point, recognizing a 6-base-pair -35 consensus TTGACA.  Sigma70 related SFs also include SFs which are dispensable for bacterial cell growth for example Ec sigmaS, SFs which activate regulons in response to a specific signal for example heat-shock Ec sigmaH, and a group of SFs which includes the extracytoplasmic function (ECF) SFs and is typified by Ec sigmaE which contains SR2 and -4 only. ECF SFs direct the transcription of genes that regulate various responses including periplasmic stress and pathogenesis.   Ec sigmaE SR4 also contacts the -35 element, but recognizes a different consensus (a 7-base-pair GGAACTT).  Plant SFs recognize sigma70 type promoters and direct transcription of the major plastid RNA polymerase, plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP).	55.0

The three genes encoding these subunits (gatA, gatB, and gatC) comprise the gatCBA operon. Galactitol PTS permease takes up exogenous galactitol, releasing the phosphate ester into the cytoplasm in preparation for oxidation and further metabolism via a modified glycolytic pathway called the tagatose-6-phosphate glycolytic pathway. The IIB domain fold includes a central four-stranded parallel open twisted beta-sheet flanked by alpha-helices on both sides. The seven major PTS systems with this IIB fold include galactitol, chitobiose/lichenan, ascorbate, lactose, mannitol, fructose, and a sensory system with similarity to the bacterial bgl system.	89.0

L29 is a protein of the large ribosomal Subunit. A homolog, called heparin/heparan sulfate interacting protein (HIP), has also been identified in mammals.  L29 is located on the surface of the large ribosomal subunit, where it participates in forming a protein ring that surrounds the polypeptide exit channel, providing structural support for the ribosome.  L29 is involved in forming the translocon binding site, along with L19, L22, L23, L24, and L31e.  In addition, L29 and L23 form the interaction site for trigger factor (TF) on the ribosomal surface, adjacent to the exit tunnel.  L29 forms numerous interactions with L23 and with the 23S rRNA. In some eukaryotes, L29 is referred to as L35, which is distinct from L35 found in bacteria and some eukaryotes (primarily plastids and mitochondria).  The mammalian homolog, HIP, is found on the surface of many tissues and cell lines. It is believed to play a role in cell adhesion and modulation of blood coagulation. It has also been shown to inhibit apoptosis in cancer cells.	57.0

Plasmids may be maintained stably in bacterial populations through the action of addiction modules, in which a toxin and antidote are encoded in a cassette on the plasmid. In any daughter cell that lacks the plasmid, the toxin persists and is lethal after the antidote protein is depleted. Toxin/antitoxin pairs are also found on main chromosomes, and likely represent selfish DNA. Sequences in the seed for this alignment all are found adjacent to RelB/DinJ family antitoxin genes (TIGR02384), as are most genes found by the resulting model. StbE from Morganella morganii plasmid R485 shows typical behaviour for an addiction module toxin. It cannot be cloned without its partner (the antitoxin), whereas its partner cannot confer plasmid stability without StbE.

It is found in the ribosomal protein S15, the influenza A viral nonstructural protein (NSA) and in several eukaryotic aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRSs), where it occurs as a single or a repeated unit. It is involved in both protein-RNA interactions by binding tRNA and protein-protein interactions in the formation of tRNA-synthetases into multienzyme complexes. While this domain lacks significant sequence similarity between the subgroups in which it is found, they share similar electrostatic surface potentials and thus are likely to bind to RNA via the same mechanism.	46.0

Plasmids may be maintained stably in bacterial populations through the action of addiction modules, in which a toxin and antidote are encoded in a cassette on the plasmid. In any daughter cell that lacks the plasmid, the toxin persists and is lethal after the antidote protein is depleted. Toxin/antitoxin pairs are also found on main chromosomes, and likely represent selfish DNA. Sequences in the seed for this alignment all are found adjacent to RelB/DinJ family antitoxin genes (TIGR02384), as are most genes found by the resulting model. StbE from Morganella morganii plasmid R485 shows typical behaviour for an addiction module toxin. It cannot be cloned without its partner (the antitoxin), whereas its partner cannot confer plasmid stability without StbE.

This subfamily includes HU and HU-like domains. HU is a conserved nucleoid-associated protein (NAP) which binds non-specifically to duplex DNA with a particular preference for targeting nicked and bent DNA. It is highly basic and contributes to chromosomal compaction and maintenance of negative supercoiling, thus often referred to as histone-like protein. HU can induce DNA bends, condense DNA in a fiber and also interact with single stranded DNA. It contains two homologous subunits, alpha and beta, typically forming homodimers (alpha-alpha and beta-beta), except in E. coli and other enterobacteria, which form heterodimers (alpha-beta). In E. coli, HU binds uniformly to the chromosome, with a preference for damaged or distorted DNA structures and can introduce negative supercoils into closed circular DNA in the presence of topoisomerase I. Anabaena HU (AHU) shows preference for A/T-rich region in the center of its DNA binding site.	86.0

It is a heterodimeric protein composed of two highly homologous subunits IHFA (IHF-alpha) and IHFB (IHF-beta). It is known to act as a transcription factor at many gene regulatory regions in E. coli. IHF is an essential cofactor in phage lambda site-specific recombination, having an architectural role during assembly of specialized nucleoprotein structures (snups). IHF is also involved in formation as well as maintenance of bacterial biofilms since it is found in complex with extracellular DNA (eDNA) within the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) matrix of many biofilms.	89.0

This family includes integration host factor (IHF) and HU, also called type II DNA-binding proteins (DNABII), which are small dimeric proteins that specifically bind the DNA minor groove, inducing large bends in the DNA and serving as architectural factors in a variety of cellular processes such as recombination, initiation of replication/transcription and gene regulation. IHF binds DNA in a sequence specific manner while HU displays little or no sequence preference. IHF homologs are usually heterodimers, while HU homologs are typically homodimers (except HU heterodimers from E. coli and other enterobacteria). HU is highly basic and contributes to chromosomal compaction and maintenance of negative supercoiling, thus often referred to as histone-like protein. IHF is an essential cofactor in phage lambda site-specific recombination, having an architectural role during assembly of specialized nucleoprotein structures (snups). Bacillus phage SPO1-encoded transcription factor 1 (TF1) is another related type II DNA-binding protein. Like IHF, TF1 binds DNA specifically and bends DNA sharply.	85.0

This group contains proteins related to bacillus phage SPO1-encoded transcription factor 1 (TF1),  a type II DNA-binding protein related to the DNA sequence specific (IHF) and non-specific (HU) domains. Type II DNA-binding proteins bind and bend DNA as dimers. Like IHF, TF1 binds DNA specifically and bends DNA sharply.  Bacteriophage SPO1-encoded TF1 recognizes SPO1 phage DNA containing 5-(hydroxymethyl)-2'-deoxyuridine as opposed to thymine,   Related  family members includes integration host factor (IHF) and HU, also called type II DNA-binding proteins (DNABII), which are small dimeric proteins that specifically bind the DNA minor groove, inducing large bends in the DNA and serving as architectural factors in a variety of cellular processes such as recombination, initiation of replication/transcription and gene regulation. IHF binds DNA in a sequence specific manner while HU displays little or no sequence preference. IHF homologs are usually heterodimers, while HU homologs are typically homodimers (except HU heterodimers from E. coli and other enterobacteria). HU is highly basic and contributes to chromosomal compaction and maintenance of negative supercoiling, thus often referred to as histone-like protein. IHF is an essential cofactor in phage lambda site-specific recombination, having an architectural role during assembly of specialized nucleoprotein structures (snups).	87.0

This subfamily consists of DNA-binding proteins similar to HU domains. HU is a conserved nucleoid-associated protein (NAP) which binds non-specifically to duplex DNA with a particular preference for targeting nicked and bent DNA. It is highly basic and contributes to chromosomal compaction and maintenance of negative supercoiling, thus often referred to as histone-like protein. HU can induce DNA bends, condense DNA in a fiber and also interact with single stranded DNA. It contains two homologous subunits, alpha and beta, typically forming homodimers (alpha-alpha and beta-beta), except in E. coli and other enterobacteria, which form heterodimers (alpha-beta).	94.0

Toxin/antitoxin pairs are also found on main chromosomes, and likely represent selfish DNA. Sequences in the seed for this alignment all were found adjacent to toxin genes.

IF1 contains an S1-like RNA-binding domain, which is found in a wide variety of RNA-associated proteins. Translation initiation includes a number of interrelated steps preceding the formation of the first peptide bond. In Escherichia coli, the initiation mechanism requires, in addition to mRNA, fMet-tRNA, and ribosomal subunits,  the presence of three additional proteins (initiation factors IF1, IF2, and IF3) and at least one GTP molecule. The three initiation factors influence both the kinetics and the stability of ternary complex formation. IF1 is the smallest of the three factors. IF1 enhances the rate of 70S ribosome subunit association and dissociation and the interaction of 30S ribosomal subunit with IF2 and IF3. It stimulates 30S complex formation. In addition, by binding to the A-site of the 30S ribosomal subunit, IF1 may contribute to the fidelity of the selection of the initiation site of the mRNA.	64.0

S1-like RNA-binding domains are found in a wide variety of RNA-associated proteins. IF1A is essential for translation initiation. eIF1A acts synergistically with eIF1 to mediate assembly of ribosomal initiation complexes at the initiation codon and maintain the accuracy of this process by recognizing and destabilizing aberrant preinitiation complexes from the mRNA. Without eIF1A and eIF1, 43S ribosomal preinitiation complexes can bind to the cap-proximal region, but are unable to reach the initiation codon. eIF1a also enhances the formation of 5'-terminal complexes in the presence of other translation initiation factors.

An excisionase, or Xis protein, is a small protein that binds and promotes excisive recombination; it is not enzymatically active. This model represents a number of putative excisionases and related proteins from temperate phage, plasmids, and transposons, as well as DNA binding domains of other proteins, such as a DNA modification methylase. This model identifies mostly small proteins and N-terminal regions of large proteins, but some proteins appear to have two copies. This domain appears similar, in both sequence and predicted secondary structure (PSIPRED) to the MerR family of transcriptional regulators (pfam00376). [Unknown function, General]	49.0

This domain model summarizes a family of DNA-binding domains unique to bacteria and represented by the Hin protein of Salmonella. The basic HTH domain is a simple fold comprised of three core helices that form a right-handed helical bundle. The principal DNA-protein interface is formed by the third helix, the recognition helix, inserting itself into the major groove of the DNA. A diverse array of HTH domains participate in a variety of functions that depend on their DNA-binding properties. HTH_Hin represents one of the simplest versions of the HTH domains; the characterization of homologous relationships between various sequence-diverse HTH domain families remains difficult. The Hin recombinase induces the site-specific inversion of a chromosomal DNA segment containing a promoter, which controls the alternate expression of two genes by reversibly switching orientation. The Hin recombinase consists of a single polypeptide chain containing a C-terminal DNA-binding domain (HTH_Hin) and a catalytic domain.	42.0

This short domain consists of a helix-turn-helix structure, which can bind to several types of RNA. It is found in the ribosomal protein S15, the influenza A viral nonstructural protein (NSA) and in several eukaryotic aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRSs), where it occurs as a single or a repeated unit. It is involved in both protein-RNA interactions by binding tRNA and protein-protein interactions in the formation of tRNA-synthetases into multienzyme complexes. While this domain lacks significant sequence similarity between the subgroups in which it is found, they share similar electrostatic surface potentials and thus are likely to bind to RNA via the same mechanism.	46.0

The chaperonins are 'helper' molecules required for correct folding and subsequent assembly of some proteins. These are required for normal cell growth, and are stress-induced, acting to stabilise or protect disassembled polypeptides under heat-shock conditions. Type I chaperonins present in eubacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts require the concerted action of 2 proteins, chaperonin 60 (cpn60) and chaperonin 10 (cpn10). The 10 kDa chaperonin (cpn10 - or groES in bacteria) exists as a ring-shaped oligomer of between six to eight identical subunits, while the 60 kDa chaperonin (cpn60 - or groEL in bacteria) forms a structure comprising 2 stacked rings, each ring containing 7 identical subunits. These ring structures assemble by self-stimulation in the presence of Mg2+-ATP. The central cavity of the cylindrical cpn60 tetradecamer provides as isolated environment for protein folding whilst cpn-10 binds to cpn-60 and synchronizes the release of the folded protein in an Mg2+-ATP dependent manner. The binding of cpn10 to cpn60 inhibits the weak ATPase activity of cpn60.	93.0

This domain contains a helix-turn-helix motif and binds DNA. Proteins belonging to this group are response regulators; some act as transcriptional activators, others as transcriptional repressors. Many are active as homodimers. Many are two domain proteins in which the DNA binding property of the C-terminal DNA binding domain is modulated by modifications of the N-terminal domain.  For example in the case of Lux R which participates in the regulation of gene expression in response to fluctuations in cell-population density (quorum-sensing), a signaling molecule, the pheromone Acyl HSL (N-acyl derivatives of homoserine lactone), binds to the N-terminal domain and leads to LuxR dimerization.  For others phophorylation of the N-terminal domain leads to multimerization, for example Escherichia coli NarL and Sinorhizobium melilot FixJ. NarL controls gene expression of many respiratory-related operons when environmental nitrate or nitrite is present under anerobic conditions. FixJ is involved in the transcriptional activation of nitrogen fixation genes. The group also includes small proteins which lack an N-terminal signaling domain, such as Bacillus subtilis GerE.  GerE is dimeric and acts in conjunction with sigmaK as an activator or a repressor modulating the expression of various genes in particular those encoding the spore-coat. These LuxR family regulators may share a similar organization of their target binding sites. For example the LuxR dimer binds the lux box, a 20bp inverted repeat, GerE dimers bind two 12bp consensus sequences in inverted orientation having the central four bases overlap, and the NarL dimer binds two 7bp inverted repeats separated by 2 bp.	57.0

This subfamily includes HU and HU-like domains. HU is a conserved nucleoid-associated protein (NAP) which binds non-specifically to duplex DNA with a particular preference for targeting nicked and bent DNA. It is highly basic and contributes to chromosomal compaction and maintenance of negative supercoiling, thus often referred to as histone-like protein. HU can induce DNA bends, condense DNA in a fiber and also interact with single stranded DNA. It contains two homologous subunits, alpha and beta, typically forming homodimers (alpha-alpha and beta-beta), except in E. coli and other enterobacteria, which form heterodimers (alpha-beta). In E. coli, HU binds uniformly to the chromosome, with a preference for damaged or distorted DNA structures and can introduce negative supercoils into closed circular DNA in the presence of topoisomerase I. Anabaena HU (AHU) shows preference for A/T-rich region in the center of its DNA binding site.	86.0

This subfamily includes integration host factor (IHF) and IHF-like domains. IHF is a nucleoid-associated protein (NAP) that binds and sharply bends many DNA targets in a sequence specific manner. It is a heterodimeric protein composed of two highly homologous subunits IHFA (IHF-alpha) and IHFB (IHF-beta). It is known to act as a transcription factor at many gene regulatory regions in E. coli. IHF is an essential cofactor in phage lambda site-specific recombination, having an architectural role during assembly of specialized nucleoprotein structures (snups). IHF is also involved in formation as well as maintenance of bacterial biofilms since it is found in complex with extracellular DNA (eDNA) within the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) matrix of many biofilms. This subfamily also includes the protein Hbb from tick-borne spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, responsible for causing Lyme disease in humans. Hbb, a homodimer, shows DNA sequence preferences that are related, yet distinct from those of IHF.	85.0

IF1 contains an S1-like RNA-binding domain, which is found in a wide variety of RNA-associated proteins. Translation initiation includes a number of interrelated steps preceding the formation of the first peptide bond. In Escherichia coli, the initiation mechanism requires, in addition to mRNA, fMet-tRNA, and ribosomal subunits,  the presence of three additional proteins (initiation factors IF1, IF2, and IF3) and at least one GTP molecule. The three initiation factors influence both the kinetics and the stability of ternary complex formation. IF1 is the smallest of the three factors. IF1 enhances the rate of 70S ribosome subunit association and dissociation and the interaction of 30S ribosomal subunit with IF2 and IF3. It stimulates 30S complex formation. In addition, by binding to the A-site of the 30S ribosomal subunit, IF1 may contribute to the fidelity of the selection of the initiation site of the mRNA.	64.0

S1-like RNA-binding domains are found in a wide variety of RNA-associated proteins. IF1A is essential for translation initiation. eIF1A acts synergistically with eIF1 to mediate assembly of ribosomal initiation complexes at the initiation codon and maintain the accuracy of this process by recognizing and destabilizing aberrant preinitiation complexes from the mRNA. Without eIF1A and eIF1, 43S ribosomal preinitiation complexes can bind to the cap-proximal region, but are unable to reach the initiation codon. eIF1a also enhances the formation of 5'-terminal complexes in the presence of other translation initiation factors. This protein family is only found in eukaryotes and archaea.	77.0

NrdH-redoxin is a representative of a class of small redox proteins that contain a conserved CXXC motif and are characterized by a glutaredoxin-like amino acid sequence and thioredoxin-like activity profile. Unlike other the glutaredoxins to which it is most closely related, NrdH aparrently does not interact with glutathione/glutathione reductase, but rather with thioredoxin reductase to catalyze the reduction of ribonucleotide reductase.	72.0

In vitro, it displays protein disulfide reductase activity that is dependent on TRX reductase, not glutathione (GSH). It is part of the NrdHIEF operon, where NrdEF codes for class Ib ribonucleotide reductase (RNR-Ib), an efficient enzyme at low oxygen levels. Under these conditions when GSH is mostly conjugated to spermidine, NrdH can still function and act as a hydrogen donor for RNR-Ib. It has been suggested that the NrdHEF system may be the oldest RNR reducing system, capable of functioning in a microaerophilic environment, where GSH was not yet available. NrdH from Corynebacterium ammoniagenes can form domain-swapped dimers, although it is unknown if this happens in vivo. Domain-swapped dimerization, which results in the blocking of the TRX reductase binding site, could be a mechanism for regulating the oxidation state of the protein.	73.0

GRX is a glutathione (GSH) dependent reductase, catalyzing the disulfide reduction of target proteins such as ribonucleotide reductase. It contains a redox active CXXC motif in a TRX fold and uses a similar dithiol mechanism employed by TRXs for intramolecular disulfide bond reduction of protein substrates. Unlike TRX, GRX has preference for mixed GSH disulfide substrates, in which it uses a monothiol mechanism where only the N-terminal cysteine is required. The flow of reducing equivalents in the GRX system goes from NADPH -> GSH reductase -> GSH -> GRX -> protein substrates. By altering the redox state of target proteins, GRX is involved in many cellular functions including DNA synthesis, signal transduction and the defense against oxidative stress. Different classes are known including  E. coli GRX1 and GRX3, which are members of this subfamily.	75.0

PRXs are thiol-specific antioxidant (TSA) proteins that confer a protective antioxidant role in cells through their peroxidase activity in which hydrogen peroxide, peroxynitrate, and organic hydroperoxides are reduced and detoxified using reducing equivalents derived from either thioredoxin, glutathione, trypanothione and AhpF. GRX is a glutathione (GSH) dependent reductase, catalyzing the disulfide reduction of target proteins. PRX-GRX hybrid proteins from Haemophilus influenza and Neisseria meningitis exhibit GSH-dependent peroxidase activity. The flow of reducing equivalents in the catalytic cycle of the hybrid protein goes from NADPH -> GSH reductase -> GSH -> GRX domain of hybrid -> PRX domain of hybrid -> peroxide substrate.	72.0

In addition, GSTs also show GSH peroxidase activity and are involved in the synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. This family, also referred to as soluble GSTs, is the largest family of GSH transferases and is only distantly related to the mitochondrial GSTs (GSTK subfamily, a member of the DsbA family). Soluble GSTs bear no structural similarity to microsomal GSTs (MAPEG family) and display additional activities unique to their group, such as catalyzing thiolysis, reduction  and isomerization of certain compounds. The GST fold contains an N-terminal TRX-fold domain and a C-terminal alpha helical domain, with an active site located in a cleft between the two domains. Based on sequence similarity, different classes of GSTs have been identified, which display varying tissue distribution, substrate specificities and additional specific activities. In humans, GSTs display polymorphisms which may influence individual susceptibility to diseases such as cancer, arthritis, allergy and sclerosis. Some GST family members with non-GST functions include glutaredoxin 2, the CLIC subfamily of anion channels, prion protein Ure2p, crystallins, metaxin 2 and stringent starvation protein A.	71.0

This small protein is part of the amidotransferase heterotrimer and appears to be important to the stability of the amidase subunit encode by gatA, but its function may not be required in every organism that expresses gatA and gatB. The seed alignment for this model does not include any eukaryotic sequence and is not guaranteed to find eukaryotic examples, although it does find some. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which expresses the amidotransferase for mitochondrial protein translation, seems to lack a gatC ortholog. This model has been revised to remove the candidate sequence from Methanococcus jannaschii, now part of a related model. [Protein synthesis, tRNA aminoacylation]	93.0

This is a family of Glu-tRNAGln amidotransferase C subunits. The Glu-tRNA Gln amidotransferase enzyme itself is an important translational fidelity mechanism replacing incorrectly charged Glu-tRNAGln with the correct Gln-tRANGln via transmidation of the misacylated Glu-tRNAGln. This activity supplements the lack of glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase activity in gram-positive eubacterteria, cyanobacteria, Archaea, and organelles.	70.0			Glu-tRNAGln amidotransferase C subunit

This domain model summarizes a family of DNA-binding domains unique to bacteria and represented by the Hin protein of Salmonella. The basic HTH domain is a simple fold comprised of three core helices that form a right-handed helical bundle. The principal DNA-protein interface is formed by the third helix, the recognition helix, inserting itself into the major groove of the DNA. A diverse array of HTH domains participate in a variety of functions that depend on their DNA-binding properties. HTH_Hin represents one of the simplest versions of the HTH domains; the characterization of homologous relationships between various sequence-diverse HTH domain families remains difficult. The Hin recombinase induces the site-specific inversion of a chromosomal DNA segment containing a promoter, which controls the alternate expression of two genes by reversibly switching orientation. The Hin recombinase consists of a single polypeptide chain containing a C-terminal DNA-binding domain (HTH_Hin) and a catalytic domain.	42.0

A SF is a dissociable subunit of RNA polymerase, it directs bacterial or plastid core RNA polymerase to specific promoter elements located upstream of transcription initiation points. The SR4 of Ec sigma70 and other essential primary SFs contact promoter sequences located 35 base-pairs upstream of the initiation point, recognizing a 6-base-pair -35 consensus TTGACA.  Sigma70 related SFs also include SFs which are dispensable for bacterial cell growth for example Ec sigmaS, SFs which activate regulons in response to a specific signal for example heat-shock Ec sigmaH, and a group of SFs which includes the extracytoplasmic function (ECF) SFs and is typified by Ec sigmaE which contains SR2 and -4 only. ECF SFs direct the transcription of genes that regulate various responses including periplasmic stress and pathogenesis.   Ec sigmaE SR4 also contacts the -35 element, but recognizes a different consensus (a 7-base-pair GGAACTT).  Plant SFs recognize sigma70 type promoters and direct transcription of the major plastid RNA polymerase, plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP).	55.0

HMA domain contains two cysteine residues that are important in binding and transfer of metal ions, such as copper, cadmium, cobalt and zinc. In the case of copper, stoichiometry of binding is one Cu+ ion per binding domain. Repeats of the HMA domain in copper chaperone has been associated with Menkes/Wilson disease due to binding of multiple copper ions.	63.0

This model describes the subunit c in F1/F0-ATP synthase, a membrane associated multisubunit complex found in bacteria and organelles of higher eukaryotes, namely, mitochondria and chloroplast. This enzyme is principally involved in the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate by coupling the energy derived from the proton electrochemical gradient across the biological membrane. A brief description of this multisubunit enzyme complex: F1 and F0 represent two major clusters of subunits. The functional role of subunit c, which is the part of F0 cluster, has been delineated in-vitro reconstitution experiments. Overall experimental proof exists that demonstrate the electrochemical gradient is converted into a rotational torque that leads to ATP synthesis.

Subunit c (also called subunit 9, or proteolipid) of the Fo complex of F-ATP synthase. The F-ATP synthase (also called FoF1-ATPase) consists of two structural domains: the F1 (factor one) complex containing the soluble catalytic core, and the Fo (oligomycin sensitive factor) complex containing the membrane proton channel, linked together by a central stalk and a peripheral stalk. F1 is composed of alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and epsilon subunits with a stoichiometry of 3:3:1:1:1, while Fo consists of the three subunits a, b, and c (1:2:10-14). An oligomeric ring of 10-14 c subunits (c-ring) make up the Fo rotor. The flux of protons though the ATPase channel (Fo) drives the rotation of the c-ring, which in turn is coupled to the rotation of the F1 complex gamma subunit rotor due to the permanent binding between the gamma and epsilon subunits of F1 and the c-ring of Fo. The F-ATP synthases are primarily found in the inner membranes of eukaryotic mitochondria, in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts, or in the plasma membranes of bacteria. The F-ATP synthases are the primary producers of ATP, using the proton gradient generated by oxidative phosphorylation (mitochondria) or photosynthesis (chloroplasts). Alternatively, under conditions of low driving force, ATP synthases function as ATPases, thus generating a transmembrane proton or Na(+) gradient at the expense of energy derived from ATP hydrolysis. This group also includes F-ATP synthase that has also been found in the archaea Methanosarcina acetivorans.	65.0

Subunit c of the Fo/Vo/Ao complex is the main transmembrane subunit of F-, V- or A-type family of ATP synthases with rotary motors. These ion-transporting rotary ATP synthases are composed of two linked multi-subunit complexes: the F1, V1, and A1 complexes contains three copies each of the alpha and beta subunits that form the soluble catalytic core, which is involved in ATP synthesis/hydrolysis, and the Fo, Vo, or Ao (oligomycin sensitive) complex that forms the membrane-embedded proton pore. The F-ATP synthases (also called FoF1-ATPases) are found in the inner membranes of eukaryotic mitochondria, in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts, or in the plasma membranes of bacteria. F-ATPases are the primary producers of ATP, using the proton gradient generated by oxidative phosphorylation (mitochondria) or photosynthesis (chloroplasts). Alternatively, under conditions of low driving force, ATP synthases function as ATPases, thus generating a transmembrane proton or Na(+) gradient at the expense of energy  derived from ATP hydrolysis. The A-ATP synthase (AoA1-ATPases) is exclusively found in archaea and function like F-ATP synthase. Structurally, however, the A-ATP synthase is more closely related to the V-ATP synthase (vacuolar VoV1-ATPase), which is a proton-translocating ATPase responsible for acidification of eukaryotic intracellular compartments and for ATP synthesis in archaea and some eubacteria. Collectively, F-, V-, and A-type synthases can function in both ATP synthesis and hydrolysis modes.	65.0

This family consists of several Enterobacterial post-segregation antitoxin CcdA proteins. The F plasmid-carried bacterial toxin, the CcdB protein, is known to act on DNA gyrase in two different ways. CcdB poisons the gyrase-DNA complex, blocking the passage of polymerases and leading to double-strand breakage of the DNA. Alternatively, in cells that overexpress CcdB, the A subunit of DNA gyrase (GyrA) has been found as an inactive complex with CcdB. Both poisoning and inactivation can be prevented and reversed in the presence of the F plasmid-encoded antidote, the CcdA protein.	71.0	CL0057	Met_repress	Post-segregation antitoxin CcdA

CSP's include the major cold-shock proteins CspA and CspB in bacteria and the eukaryotic gene regulatory factor Y-box protein. CSP expression is up-regulated by an abrupt drop in growth temperature. CSP's are also expressed under normal condition at lower level. The function of cold-shock proteins is not fully understood. They preferentially bind poly-pyrimidine region of single-stranded RNA and DNA.  CSP's are thought to bind mRNA and regulate ribosomal translation, mRNA degradation, and  the rate of transcription termination. The human Y-box protein, which contains a CSD, regulates transcription and translation of genes that contain the Y-box sequence in their promoters. This specific ssDNA-binding properties of CSD are required for the binding of Y-box protein to the promoter's Y-box sequence, thereby regulating transcription.	65.0

Beside the Escherichia coli ethanolamine utilization protein EutN and the Synechocystis sp. carboxysome (beta-type) structural protein CcmL, this family also includes alpha-type carboxysome structural proteins CsoS4A and CsoS4B (previously known as OrfA and OrfB), propanediol utilizationprotein PduN, and some hypothetical homologous of various bacterial microcompartments. The carboxysome, a polyhedral organelle, participates in carbon fixation by sequestering enzymes. It is the prototypical bacterial microcompartment. Its enzymatic components, ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase(RuBisCO) and carbonic anhydrase (CA), are surrounded by a polyhedral protein shell. Similarly, the ethanolamine utilization (eut) microcompartment, and the 1,2-propanediol utilization (pdu) microcompartment encapsulate the enzymes necessary for the process of cobalamin-dependent ethanolamine degradation, and coenzyme B12-dependent degradation of 1,2-propanediol, respectively, within its polyhedral protein shells. It is interesting that both carboxysome structural proteins CcmL and CsoS4A assemble as pentamers in the crystal structures, which might constitute the twelve pentameric vertices of a regular icosahedral carboxysome. However, the reported EutN structure is hexameric rather than pentameric. The absence of pentamers in Eut microcompartments might lead to less-regular icosahedral shell shapes. Due to the lack of structure evidence, the functional roles of the CsoS4A adjacent paralog, CsoS4B, and propanediol utilization protein PduN are not yet clear.	83.0

The chaperonins are 'helper' molecules required for correct folding and subsequent assembly of some proteins. These are required for normal cell growth, and are stress-induced, acting to stabilise or protect disassembled polypeptides under heat-shock conditions. Type I chaperonins present in eubacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts require the concerted action of 2 proteins, chaperonin 60 (cpn60) and chaperonin 10 (cpn10). The 10 kDa chaperonin (cpn10 - or groES in bacteria) exists as a ring-shaped oligomer of between six to eight identical subunits, while the 60 kDa chaperonin (cpn60 - or groEL in bacteria) forms a structure comprising 2 stacked rings, each ring containing 7 identical subunits. These ring structures assemble by self-stimulation in the presence of Mg2+-ATP. The central cavity of the cylindrical cpn60 tetradecamer provides as isolated environment for protein folding whilst cpn-10 binds to cpn-60 and synchronizes the release of the folded protein in an Mg2+-ATP dependent manner. The binding of cpn10 to cpn60 inhibits the weak ATPase activity of cpn60.	93.0

Included in this group is the C-terminus of mitochondrial Elongation factor G1 (mtEFG1) and G2 (mtEFG2) proteins. Eukaryotic cells harbor 2 protein synthesis systems: one localized in the cytoplasm, the other in the mitochondria. Most factors regulating mitochondrial protein synthesis are encoded by nuclear genes, translated in the cytoplasm, and then transported to the mitochondria. The eukaryotic system of elongation factor (EF) components is more complex than that in prokaryotes, with both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial elongation factors and multiple isoforms being expressed in certain species. During the process of peptide synthesis and tRNA site changes, the ribosome is moved along the mRNA a distance equal to one codon with the addition of each amino acid. In bacteria this translocation step is catalyzed by EF-G_GTP, which is hydrolyzed to provide the required energy. Thus, this action releases the uncharged tRNA from the P site and transfers the newly formed peptidyl-tRNA from the A site to the P site. Eukaryotic mtEFG1 proteins show significant homology to bacterial EF-Gs.  Mutants in yeast mtEFG1 have impaired mitochondrial protein synthesis, respiratory defects and a tendency to lose mitochondrial DNA. No clear phenotype has been found for mutants in the yeast homologue of mtEFG2, MEF2.	78.0

This domain includes the carboxyl terminal regions of elongation factors (EFs) bacterial EF-G, eukaryotic and archeal EF-2 and eukaryotic mitochondrial mtEFG1s and mtEFG2s. This group also includes proteins similar to the ribosomal protection proteins Tet(M) and Tet(O), BipA, LepA and, spliceosomal proteins: human 116kD U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) protein (U5-116 kD) and yeast counterpart Snu114p.  This domain adopts a ferredoxin-like fold consisting of an alpha-beta sandwich with anti-parallel beta-sheets, resembling the topology of domain III found in the elongation factors EF-G and eukaryotic EF-2, with which it forms the C-terminal block. The two domains however are not superimposable and domain III lacks some of the characteristics of this domain.  EF-2/EF-G in complex with GTP, promotes the translocation step of translation. During translocation the peptidyl-tRNA is moved from the A site to the P site, the uncharged tRNA from the P site to the E-site and, the mRNA is shifted one codon relative to the ribosome. Tet(M) and Tet(O) mediate Tc resistance. Typical Tcs bind to the ribosome and inhibit the elongation phase of protein synthesis, by inhibiting the occupation of site A by aminoacyl-tRNA. Tet(M) and Tet(O) catalyze the release of tetracycline (Tc) from the ribosome in a GTP-dependent manner.  BipA is a highly conserved protein with global regulatory properties in Escherichia coli. Yeast Snu114p is essential for cell viability and for splicing in vivo. Experiments suggest that GTP binding and probably GTP hydrolysis is important for the function of the U5-116 kD/Snu114p. The function of LepA proteins is unknown.	79.0

A member of the ribosome binding GTPase superfamily, BipA is widely distributed in bacteria and plants.  BipA is a highly conserved protein with global regulatory properties in Escherichia coli. BipA is phosphorylated on a tyrosine residue under some cellular conditions. Mutants show altered regulation of some pathways. BipA functions as a translation factor that is required specifically for the expression of the transcriptional modulator Fis.  BipA binds to ribosomes at a site that coincides with that of EF-G and has a GTPase activity that is sensitive to high GDP:GTP ratios and, is stimulated  by 70S ribosomes programmed with mRNA and aminoacylated tRNAs. The growth rate-dependent induction of BipA allows the efficient expression of Fis, thereby modulating a range of downstream processes, including DNA metabolism and type III secretion.	79.0

LepA is ubiquitous in Bacteria and Eukaryota (e.g. Saccharomyces cerevisiae GUF1p), but is missing from Archaea. LepA exhibits significant homology to elongation factors (EFs) Tu and G. The function(s) of the proteins in this family are unknown. The N-terminal domain of LepA is homologous to a domain of similar size found in initiation factor 2 (IF2), and in EF-Tu and EF-G (factors required for translation in Escherichia coli). Two types of phylogenetic tree, rooted by other GTP-binding proteins, suggest that eukaryotic homologs (including S. cerevisiae GUF1) originated within the bacterial LepA family. LepA has never been observed in archaea, and eukaryl LepA is organellar. LepA is therefore a true bacterial GTPase, found only in the bacterial lineage.	80.0

This CD includes the second of two ACT domains located C-terminal to the catalytic domain of the lysine-sensitive aspartokinase isoenzyme AKIII, a monofunctional class enzyme found in bacteria (Escherichia coli (EC) LysC). Aspartokinase is the first enzyme in the aspartate metabolic pathway and catalyzes the conversion of aspartate and ATP to aspartylphosphate and ADP. The E. coli AKIII (LysC) binds two feedback allosteric inhibitor lysine molecules at the dimer interface located between the ACT1 domain of two subunits.

This CD includes the second of two ACT domains C-terminal to the catalytic domain of aspartokinase (AK; 4-L-aspartate-4-phosphotransferase). The exception in this group, is the inclusion of the first ACT domain of the bifunctional  aspartokinase - homoserine dehydrogenase-like enzyme group (ACT_AKi-HSDH-ThrA-like_1) which includes the  monofunctional,  threonine-sensitive, aspartokinase found  in Methanococcus jannaschii and other related archaeal species. AK catalyzes the conversion of aspartate and ATP to aspartylphosphate and ADP. AK is the first enzyme in the pathway of the biosynthesis of the aspartate family of amino acids (lysine, threonine, methionine, and isoleucine) and the bacterial cell wall component, meso-diaminopimelate. One mechanism for the regulation of this pathway is by the production of several isoenzymes of AK with different repressors and allosteric inhibitors. Pairs of ACT domains are proposed to specifically bind amino acids leading to allosteric regulation of the enzyme. In Escherichia coli (EC), three different AK isoenzymes are regulated specifically by lysine, methionine, and threonine. AK-HSDHI (ThrA) and AK-HSDHII (MetL) are bifunctional enzymes that consist of an N-terminal AK and a C-terminal homoserine dehydrogenase (HSDH). ThrA and MetL are involved in threonine and methionine biosynthesis, respectively. The third isoenzyme, AKIII (LysC), is monofunctional and is involved in lysine synthesis. The three Bacillus subtilis (BS) isoenzymes, AKI (DapG), AKII (LysC), and AKIII (YclM), are feedback inhibited by meso-diaminopimelate, lysine, and lysine plus threonine, respectively. The E. coli lysine-sensitive AK is described as a homodimer, whereas, the B. subtilis lysine-sensitive AK is described as is a heterodimeric complex of alpha- and beta- subunits that are formed from two in-frame overlapping genes. A single AK enzyme type has been described in Pseudomonas, Amycolatopsis, and Corynebacterium, and apparently, unique to cyanobacteria, are AKs with two tandem pairs of ACT domains, C-terminal to the catalytic domain. The fungal aspartate pathway is regulated at the AK step, with L-Thr being an allosteric inhibitor of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae AK (Hom3). At least two distinct AK isoenzymes can occur in higher plants, a monofunctional lysine-sensitive isoenzyme, which is involved in the overall regulation of the pathway and can be synergistically inhibited by S-adenosylmethionine. The other isoenzyme is a bifunctional, threonine-sensitive AK-HSDH protein. Also included in this CD are the ACT domains of the Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum AK; the first enzyme of the ectoine biosynthetic pathway found in this bacterium and several other halophilic/halotolerant bacteria.

This CD includes each of two ACT domains C-terminal to the catalytic domain of aspartokinase (AK; 4-L-aspartate-4-phosphotransferase). Typically, AK consists of two ACT domains in a tandem repeat, but the second ACT domain is inserted within the first, resulting in, what is normally the terminal beta strand of ACT2, formed from a region N-terminal of ACT1. AK catalyzes the conversion of aspartate and ATP to aspartylphosphate and ADP. Aspartokinase is the first enzyme in the pathway of the biosynthesis of the aspartate family of amino acids (lysine, threonine, methionine, and isoleucine) and the bacterial cell wall component, meso-diaminopimelate.

This CD includes the second of two ACT domains located C-terminal to the catalytic domain of the aspartokinase (AK) HOM3, a monofunctional class enzyme found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and other related ACT domains. AK is the first enzyme in the aspartate metabolic pathway, catalyzes the conversion of aspartate and ATP to aspartylphosphate and ADP, and in fungi, is responsible for the production of threonine, isoleucine and methionine. S. cerevisiae has a single AK, which is regulated by feedback, allosteric inhibition by L-threonine. Recent studies shown that the allosteric transition triggered by binding of threonine to AK involves a large change in the conformation of the native hexameric enzyme that is converted to an inactive one of different shape and substantially smaller hydrodynamic size.

This CD includes the second  of two ACT domains of the bifunctional enzyme aspartokinase (AK) - homoserine dehydrogenase (HSDH). The ACT domains are positioned between the N-terminal catalytic domain of AK and the C-terminal HSDH domain found in bacteria (Escherichia coli (EC) ThrA) and higher plants (Zea mays AK-HSDH). AK and HSDH are the first and third enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway of the aspartate family of amino acids. AK catalyzes the phosphorylation of Asp to P-aspartyl phosphate. HSDH catalyzes the NADPH-dependent conversion of Asp 3-semialdehyde to homoserine. HSDH is the first committed reaction in the branch of the pathway that leads to Thr and Met. In E. coli, ThrA is subject to allosteric regulation by the end product L-threonine and the native enzyme is reported to be tetrameric. As with bacteria, plant AK and HSDH are feedback inhibited by pathway end products. Maize AK-HSDH is a Thr-sensitive 180-kD enzyme. Arabidopsis AK-HSDH is an alanine-activated, threonine-sensitive enzyme whose ACT domains were shown to be involved in allosteric activation.

TTRAP is a family of small bacterial proteins largely from Clostrium difficile. From comparative and other structural studies of the Structure 2L7K, UniProtKB:Q18AW3, it has been suggested that this family is required for interacting with other proteins in order to facilitate the transfer of the transposon CTn4 between different bacterial species. Structure 2L7K comprises an alpha-helical fold of four alpha-helices leading to the production of two clefts, the larger of which displays two highly conserved residues in close proximity, Glu-8 and Lys-48. The gene concerned is part of an operon within transposon CTn4, and is expressed alongside a putative DNA primase, a DNA topoisomerase and conjugal transfer proteins.	62.0			Putative transposon-transfer assisting protein

IF1 contains an S1-like RNA-binding domain, which is found in a wide variety of RNA-associated proteins. Translation initiation includes a number of interrelated steps preceding the formation of the first peptide bond. In Escherichia coli, the initiation mechanism requires, in addition to mRNA, fMet-tRNA, and ribosomal subunits,  the presence of three additional proteins (initiation factors IF1, IF2, and IF3) and at least one GTP molecule. The three initiation factors influence both the kinetics and the stability of ternary complex formation. IF1 is the smallest of the three factors. IF1 enhances the rate of 70S ribosome subunit association and dissociation and the interaction of 30S ribosomal subunit with IF2 and IF3. It stimulates 30S complex formation. In addition, by binding to the A-site of the 30S ribosomal subunit, IF1 may contribute to the fidelity of the selection of the initiation site of the mRNA.	64.0

IF1A is essential for translation initiation. eIF1A acts synergistically with eIF1 to mediate assembly of ribosomal initiation complexes at the initiation codon and maintain the accuracy of this process by recognizing and destabilizing aberrant preinitiation complexes from the mRNA. Without eIF1A and eIF1, 43S ribosomal preinitiation complexes can bind to the cap-proximal region, but are unable to reach the initiation codon. eIF1a also enhances the formation of 5'-terminal complexes in the presence of other translation initiation factors.

In vitro, it displays protein disulfide reductase activity that is dependent on TRX reductase, not glutathione (GSH). It is part of the NrdHIEF operon, where NrdEF codes for class Ib ribonucleotide reductase (RNR-Ib), an efficient enzyme at low oxygen levels. Under these conditions when GSH is mostly conjugated to spermidine, NrdH can still function and act as a hydrogen donor for RNR-Ib. It has been suggested that the NrdHEF system may be the oldest RNR reducing system, capable of functioning in a microaerophilic environment, where GSH was not yet available. NrdH from Corynebacterium ammoniagenes can form domain-swapped dimers, although it is unknown if this happens in vivo. Domain-swapped dimerization, which results in the blocking of the TRX reductase binding site, could be a mechanism for regulating the oxidation state of the protein.	73.0

PRXs are thiol-specific antioxidant (TSA) proteins that confer a protective antioxidant role in cells through their peroxidase activity in which hydrogen peroxide, peroxynitrate, and organic hydroperoxides are reduced and detoxified using reducing equivalents derived from either thioredoxin, glutathione, trypanothione and AhpF. GRX is a glutathione (GSH) dependent reductase, catalyzing the disulfide reduction of target proteins. PRX-GRX hybrid proteins from Haemophilus influenza and Neisseria meningitis exhibit GSH-dependent peroxidase activity. The flow of reducing equivalents in the catalytic cycle of the hybrid protein goes from NADPH -> GSH reductase -> GSH -> GRX domain of hybrid -> PRX domain of hybrid -> peroxide substrate.	72.0

A SF is a dissociable subunit of RNA polymerase, it directs bacterial or plastid core RNA polymerase to specific promoter elements located upstream of transcription initiation points. The SR4 of Ec sigma70 and other essential primary SFs contact promoter sequences located 35 base-pairs upstream of the initiation point, recognizing a 6-base-pair -35 consensus TTGACA.  Sigma70 related SFs also include SFs which are dispensable for bacterial cell growth for example Ec sigmaS, SFs which activate regulons in response to a specific signal for example heat-shock Ec sigmaH, and a group of SFs which includes the extracytoplasmic function (ECF) SFs and is typified by Ec sigmaE which contains SR2 and -4 only. ECF SFs direct the transcription of genes that regulate various responses including periplasmic stress and pathogenesis.   Ec sigmaE SR4 also contacts the -35 element, but recognizes a different consensus (a 7-base-pair GGAACTT).  Plant SFs recognize sigma70 type promoters and direct transcription of the major plastid RNA polymerase, plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP).	55.0

In Myxococcus xanthus PdxH, S6 runs from residues 178-192, S7 from 200-206 and S8 from 211-215. the extended loop, of residues 167-177 may well be involved in the pocket formed between the two dimers that positions the FMN molecule.To date, the only time functional oxidase or phenazine biosynthesis activities have been experimentally demonstrated is when the sequences contain both pfam01243 and pfam10590. It is unknown the role performed by each domain in bringing about molecular functions of either oxidase or phenazine activity.	42.0			Pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase C-terminal dimerisation region

This short domain consists of a helix-turn-helix structure, which can bind to several types of RNA. It is found in the ribosomal protein S15, the influenza A viral nonstructural protein (NSA) and in several eukaryotic aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRSs), where it occurs as a single or a repeated unit. It is involved in both protein-RNA interactions by binding tRNA and protein-protein interactions in the formation of tRNA-synthetases into multienzyme complexes. While this domain lacks significant sequence similarity between the subgroups in which it is found, they share similar electrostatic surface potentials and thus are likely to bind to RNA via the same mechanism.	46.0

Ubiquitin-like (Ubl) proteins have similar ubiquitin beta-grasp fold and attach to other proteins in a Ubl manner but with biochemically distinct roles. Ubiquitin (Ub)and Ubl proteins conjugate and deconjugate via ligases and peptidases to covalently modify target polypeptides.

NEDD8, also termed Neddylin, or RELATED TO UBIQUITIN (RUB/Rub1p) in plant and yeast, is a ubiquitin-like protein that conjugates to nuclear proteins in a manner analogous to ubiquitination and sentrinization. It modifies a family of molecular scaffold proteins called cullins that are responsible for assembling the ROC1/Rbx1 RING-based E3 ubiquitin ligases, of which several play a direct role in tumorigenesis. NEDD8 deamidation and its inhibition of Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) activity are responsible for Cycle-inhibiting factor (Cif)/Cif homolog in Burkholderia pseudomallei (CHBP)-induced cytopathic effect. NEDD8 contains a single conserved ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain with a beta-grasp Ubl fold, a common structure involved in protein-protein interactions. Polyubiquitination, signals for a diverse set of cellular events via different isopeptide linkages formed between the C terminus of one ubiquitin (Ub) and the epsilon-amine of K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48, or K63 of a second Ub. Ubl NEDD8, contains many of the same lysines (K6, K11, K27, K33, K48) as Ub, where K27 has an role (other than conjugation) in the mechanism of protein neddylation.	74.0

Ubiquitin-like (Ubl) proteins have a similar ubiquitin (Ub) beta-grasp fold and attach to other proteins in a Ubl manner but with biochemically distinct roles. Ub and Ubl proteins conjugate and deconjugate via ligases and peptidases to covalently modify target polypeptides. Some Ubl domains have adaptor roles in Ub-signaling by mediating protein-protein interaction. Prokaryotic sulfur carrier proteins are Ub-related proteins that can be activated in an ATP-dependent manner. Polyubiquitination signals for a diverse set of cellular events via different isopeptide linkages formed between the C terminus of one ubiquitin (Ub) and the epsilon-amine of K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48, or K63 of a second Ub. One of these seven lysine residues (K27, Ub numbering) is conserved in this Ubl_ubiquitin_like family.  K27-linked Ub chains are versatile and can be recognized by several downstream receptor proteins. K27 has roles beyond chain linkage, such as in Ubl NEDD8 (which contains many of the same lysines (K6, K11, K27, K33, K48) as Ub) where K27 has a role (other than conjugation) in the mechanism of protein neddylation.	68.0

ZFAND4, also termed AN1-type zinc finger and ubiquitin domain-containing protein-like 1 (ANUBL1), may function as an oncogene that promotes proliferation and regulates relevant tumor suppressor genes in gastric cancer, suggesting a role in gastric cancer initiation and progression. ZFAND4contains an N-terminal ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain with a beta-grasp Ubl fold, a common structure involved in protein-protein interactions, as well as a C-terminal AN1-type zinc finger.

It is also associated with cancer development, antigen processing and antimicrobial defense, chromosomal stability and cell cycle regulation. FAT10 is presented on immune cells and under the inflammatory conditions, is synergistically induced by interferon gamma (IFNgamma) and tumor necrosis factor (TNFalpha) in the non-immune (liver parenchymal) cells. FAT10 contains two Ubl domains. The family corresponds to the second Ubl domain of FAT10. Some family members contain only one Ubl domain.	71.0

UBL4A, also termed GdX, is a ubiquitously expressed ubiquitin-like (Ubl) protein that forms a complex with partner proteins and participates in the protein processing through endoplasmic reticulum (ER), acting as a chaperone. As a key component of the BCL2-associated athanogene 6 (BAG6) chaperone complex, UBL4A plays a role in mediating DNA damage signaling and cell death. UBL4A also regulates insulin-induced Akt plasma membrane translocation through promotion of Arp2/3-dependent actin branching. Moreover, UBL4A specifically stabilizes the TC45/STAT3 association and promotes dephosphorylation of STAT3 to repress tumorigenesis. UBL4B is testis-specific, and encoded by an X-derived retrogene Ubl4b, which is specifically expressed in post-meiotic germ cells in mammals. As a germ cell-specific cytoplasmic protein, UBL4B is not present in somatic cells. Moreover, UBL4B is present in elongated spermatids, but not in spermatocytes and round spermatids, suggesting its function is restricted to late spermiogenesis. The function of UBL4A may be compensated by either UBL4B or other Ubl proteins in normal conditions. Both UBL4A and UBL4B contain a conserved Ubl domain with a beta-grasp Ubl fold, a common structure involved in protein-protein interactions.	72.0

The Rad23 family includes the yeast nucleotide excision repair (NER) proteins, Rad23p (in Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and Rhp23p (in Schizosaccharomyces pombe), their mammalian orthologs HR23A and HR23B, and putative DNA repair proteins from plants. Rad23 proteins play dual roles in DNA repair as well as in proteosomal degradation. They have affinity for both the proteasome and ubiquitinylated proteins and participate in translocating polyubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome. Rad23 proteins carry an ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain with a beta-grasp Ubl fold, and two ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains, as well as a xeroderma pigmentosum group C (XPC) protein-binding domain. The Ubl domain is responsible for the binding to proteasome. The UBA domains are important for binding of ubiquitin (Ub) or multi-ubiquitinated substrates, which suggests Rad23 proteins might be involved in certain pathways of Ub metabolism. Both the Ubl domain and the XPC-binding domain are necessary for efficient NER function of Rad23 proteins.	72.0

The family contains several fungal multiubiquitin receptors, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae Dsk2p and Schizosaccharomyces pombe Dph1p, both of which have been characterized as shuttle proteins transporting ubiquitinated substrates destined for degradation from the E3 ligase to the 26S proteasome. They interact with the proteasome through their N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain (Ubl) and with ubiquitin (Ub) through their C-terminal Ub-associated domain (UBA). S. cerevisiae Dsk2p is a nuclear-enriched protein that may involve in the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway through interacting with K48-linked polyubiquitin and the proteasome. Moreover, it has been implicated in spindle pole duplication through assisting in Cdc31 assembly into the new spindle pole body (SPB). S. pombe Dph1p is an ubiquitin (Ub0 receptor working in concert with the class V myosin, Myo52, to target the degradation of the S. pombe CLIP-170 homolog, Tip1. It also can protect Ub chains against disassembly by deubiquitinating enzymes.	73.0

Ubiquitin is a protein modifier that is involved in various cellular processes including transcriptional regulation, cell cycle control, and DNA repair in eukaryotes. The ubiquitination process comprises a cascade of E1, E2 and E3 enzymes that results in a covalent bond between the C-terminus of ubiquitin and the epsilon-amino group of a substrate lysine. Ubiquitin-like proteins have similar ubiquitin beta-grasp fold and attach to other proteins in a ubiquitin-like manner but with biochemically distinct roles. Ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins conjugate and deconjugate via ligases and peptidases to covalently modify target polypeptides. Some other ubiquitin-like domains have adaptor roles in ubiquitin-signaling by mediating protein-protein interaction. In addition to Ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain, Ras-associating (RA) domain,  F0/F1 sub-domain of FERM (Four.1 protein, Ezrin, Radixin, Moesin) domain, TGS (ThrRS, GTPase and SpoT) domain, Ras-binding domain (RBD),  Ubiquitin regulatory domain X (UBX), Dublecortin-like domain, and RING finger- and WD40-associated ubiquitin-like (RAWUL) domain have beta-grasp ubiquitin-like folds, and are included in this superfamily.	68.0

Parkin, also termed Parkinson juvenile disease protein 2, is a RBR-type E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that is associated with recessive early onset Parkinson's disease (PD), and exerts a protective effect against dopamine-induced alpha-synuclein-dependent cell toxicity. Mutations in the parkin gene cause autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism. Parkin functions within a multiprotein E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, catalyzing the covalent attachment of ubiquitin moieties onto substrate proteins, such as BCL2, SYT11, CCNE1, GPR37, RHOT1/MIRO1, MFN1, MFN2, STUB1, SNCAIP, SEPT5, TOMM20, USP30, ZNF746 and AIMP2. It mediates monoubiquitination as well as Lys-6-, Lys-11-, Lys-48- and Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination of substrates depending on the context. Parkin may enhance cell viability and protects dopaminergic neurons from oxidative stress-mediated death by regulating mitochondrial function. It also limits the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and regulates cyclin-E during neuronal apoptosis. Moreover, parkin displays a ubiquitin ligase-independent function in transcriptional repression of p53. Parkin contains an N-terminal ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain and a C-terminal RBR domain that was previously known as RING-BetweenRING-RING domain or TRIAD [two RING fingers and a DRIL (double RING finger linked)] domain. Based on current understanding of the structural biology of RBR ligases, the nomenclature of RBR has been corrected as RING-BRcat (benign-catalytic)-Rcat (required-for-catalysis) recently. The RBR (RING1-BRcat-Rcat) domain use an auto-inhibitory mechanism to modulate ubiquitination activity, as well as a hybrid mechanism that combines aspects from both RING and HECT E3 ligase function to facilitate the ubiquitination reaction.	74.0

BAG6, also termed large proline-rich protein BAG6, or BAG family molecular chaperone regulator 6, or HLA-B-associated transcript 3 (Bat3), or protein Scythe, or protein G3, is a nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling chaperone protein that is highly conserved in eukaryotes. It functions in two distinct biological pathways, ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation of defective polypeptides and tail-anchored transmembrane protein biogenesis in mammals. BAG6 is a component of the heterotrimeric BAG6 sortase complex composed of BAG6, transmembrane recognition complex 35 (TRC35) and ubiquitin-like protein 4A (UBL4A). The BAG6 complex together with the cochaperone small, glutamine-rich, tetratricopeptide repeat-containing, protein alpha (SGTA) plays a role in the biogenesis of tail-anchored membrane proteins and subsequently shown to regulate the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of mislocalized proteins. Moreover, BAG6 acts as an apoptotic regulator that binds reaper, a potent apoptotic inducer. BAG6/reaper is thought to signal apoptosis, in part through regulating the folding and activity of apoptotic signaling molecules. It is also likely a key regulator of the molecular chaperone Heat Shock Protein A2 (HSPA2) stability/function in human germ cells. Furthermore, aspartyl protease-mediated cleavage of BAG6 is necessary for autophagy and fungal resistance in plants. BAG6 contains a ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain with a beta-grasp Ubl fold, which provides a platform for discriminating substrates with shorter hydrophobicity stretches as a signal for defective proteins.	71.0

The small ubiquitin-related modifier SUMO-1 is a Ub/Ubl family member, and although SUMO-1 shares structural similarity to Ub, SUMO's cellular functions remain distinct insomuch as SUMO modification alters protein function through changes in activity, cellular localization, or by protecting substrates from ubiquitination. Rad60 family members contain functionally enigmatic, integral SUMO-like domains (SLDs). Despite their divergence from SUMO, each Rad60 SLD interacts with a subset of SUMO pathway enzymes: SLD2 specifically binds the SUMO E2 conjugating enzyme (Ubc9)), whereas SLD1 binds the SUMO E1 (Fub2, also called Uba2) activating and E3 (Pli1, also called Siz1 and Siz2) specificity enzymes. Structural analysis of Structure 2uyz reveals a mechanistic basis for the near-synonymous roles of Rad60 and SUMO in survival of genotoxic stress and suggest unprecedented DNA-damage-response functions for SLDs in regulating SUMOylation. The Rad60 branch of this family is also known as RENi (Rad60-Esc2-Nip45), and biologically it should be two distinct families SUMO and RENi (Rad60-Esc2-Nip45).	72.0	CL0072	Ubiquitin	Ubiquitin-2 like Rad60 SUMO-like

OASL, also termed 2'-5'-OAS-related protein (2'-5'-OAS-RP), or 59 kDa 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthase-like protein, or thyroid receptor-interacting protein 14, or TR-interacting protein 14 (TRIP-14), or p59 OASL (p59OASL), is an interferon (IFN)-induced antiviral protein that plays an important role in the IFNs-mediated antiviral signaling pathway. It inhibits respiratory syncytial virus replication and is targeted by the viral nonstructural protein 1 (NS1). It also displays antiviral activity against encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) via an alternative antiviral pathway independent of RNase L. Moreover, OASL does not have 2'-5'-OAS activity, but can bind double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to enhance RIG-I signaling. OASL belongs to the 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthase (OAS) family. While each member of this family has a conserved N-terminal OAS catalytic domain, only OASL has two tandem C-terminal ubiquitin-like (Ubl) repeats, which are required for its antiviral activity. This family corresponds to the second Ubl domain.	72.0

Although ISG15 has properties similar to those of other Ubl molecules, it is a unique member of the Ubl superfamily, whose expression and conjugation to target proteins are tightly regulated by specific signaling pathways, indicating it may have specialized functions in the immune system.

The eukaryotic Ddi1 family, including yeast aspartyl protease DNA-damage inducible 1 (Ddi1) and Ddi1-like proteins from vertebrates and other eukaryotes, has been characterized by containing an N-terminal ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain and a conserved retroviral aspartyl-protease-like domain (RVP) that is important in cell-cycle control. Yeast Ddi1 and many family members also contain a C-terminal ubiquitin-association (UBA) domain, however, Ddi1-like proteins from all vertebrates lack the UBA domain. Ddi1, also termed v-SNARE-master 1 (Vsm1), is an ubiquitin receptor involved in the cell cycle and late secretory pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It functions as an UBA-Ubl shuttle protein that is required for the proteasome to enable ubiquitin-dependent degradation of its ligands. For instance, Ddi1 plays an essential role in the final stages of proteasomal degradation of Ho endonuclease and of its cognate FBP, Ufo1. Moreover, Ddi1 and its associated protein Rad23p play a cooperative role as negative regulators in yeast PHO pathway. This family also includes mammalian regulatory solute carrier protein family 1 member 1 (RSC1A1), also termed transporter regulator RS1 (RS1), which mediates transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of Na(+)-D-glucose cotransporter SGLT1. Ddi1-like proteins play a significant role in cell cycle control, growth control, and trafficking in yeast and may play a crucial role in embryogenesis in higher eukaryotes.	73.0

UHRF1 is a unique chromatin effector protein that integrates the recognition of both histone PTMs and DNA methylation. It is essential for cell proliferation and plays a critical role in the development and progression of many human carcinomas, such as laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, gastric cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, and breast cancer. UHRF1 can acts as a transcriptional repressor through its binding to histone H3 when it is unmodified at Arg2. Its overexpression in human lung fibroblasts results in downregulation of expression of the tumor suppressor pRB. It also plays a role in transcriptional repression of the cell cycle regulator p21. Moreover, UHRF1-dependent repression of factors can facilitate the G1-S transition. It interacts with Tat-interacting protein of 60 kDa (TIP60) and induces degradation-independent ubiquitination of TIP60. It is also an N-methylpurine DNA glycosylase (MPG)-interacting protein that binds MPG in a p53 status-independent manner in the DNA base excision repair (BER) pathway. In addition, UHRF1 functions as an epigenetic regulator that is important for multiple aspects of epigenetic regulation, including maintenance of DNA methylation patterns and recognition of various histone modifications. UHRF2 was originally identified as a ubiquitin ligase acting as a small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) E3 ligase that enhances zinc finger protein 131 (ZNF131) SUMOylation but does not enhance ZNF131 ubiquitination. It also ubiquitinates PCNP, a PEST-containing nuclear protein. Moreover, UHRF2 functions as a nuclear protein involved in cell-cycle regulation and has been implicated in tumorigenesis. It interacts with cyclins, CDKs, p53, pRB, PCNA, HDAC1, DNMTs, G9a, methylated histone H3 lysine 9, and methylated DNA. It interacts with the cyclin E-CDK2 complex, ubiquitinates cyclins D1 and E1, induces G1 arrest, and is involved in the G1/S transition regulation. Furthermore, UHRF2 is a direct transcriptional target of the transcription factor E2F-1 in the induction of apoptosis. It recruits HDAC1 and binds to methyl-CpG. UHRF2 also participates in the maturation of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) through interacting with HBV core protein and promoting its degradation. Both UHRF1 and UHRF2 contain an N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain (Ubl), a tandem Tudor domain (TTD), a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger, a set- and ring-associated (SRA) domain, and a C-terminal RING finger.	74.0

The PLIC proteins (or ubiquilins) family contains human homologs of the yeast ubiquitin-like (Ubl) Dsk2 protein, PLIC-1 (also termed ubiquilin-1), PLIC-2 (also termed ubiquilin-2, or Chap1), PLIC-3 (also termed ubiquilin-3) and PLIC-4 (also termed ubiquilin-4, ataxin-1 interacting ubiquitin-like protein, A1Up, connexin43-interacting protein of 75 kDa, or CIP75), and mouse PLIC proteins. They are ubiquitin (Ub)-binding adaptor proteins involved in all protein degradation pathways through delivering ubiquitinated substrates to proteasomes. They also promote autophagy-dependent cell survival during nutrient starvation. PLIC-1 regulates the function of the thrombospondin receptor CD47 and G protein signaling. It plays a role in TLR4-mediated signaling through interacting with the Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain of TLR4. It also inhibits the TLR3-Trif antiviral pathway by reducing the abundance of Trif. Moreover, PLIC-1 binds to gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABAARs) and modulates the Ub-dependent, proteasomal degradation of GABAARs. Furthermore, PLIC-1 acts as a molecular chaperone regulating amyloid precursor protein (APP) biosynthesis, trafficking, and degradation by stimulating K63-linked polyubiquitination of lysine 688 in the APP intracellular domain. In addition, PLIC-1 is involved in the protein aggregation-stress pathway via associating with the Ub-interacting motif (UIM) proteins ataxin 3, HSJ1a, and epidermal growth factor substrate 15 (EPS15). PLIC-2 is a protein that binds the ATPase domain of the HSP70-like Stch protein. It functions as a negative regulator of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) endocytosis. It also involved in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-related dementia. PLIC-3 is encoded by UbiquilinN3, a testis-specific gene. It shows high sequence similarity with the Xenopus protein XDRP1, a nuclear phosphoprotein that binds to the N-terminus of cyclin A and inhibits Ca2+-induced degradation of cyclin A, but not cyclin B. PLIC-4 is an ubiquitin-like (Ubl) nuclear protein that interacts with ataxin-1 and further links ataxin-1 with the chaperone and Ub-proteasome pathways. It also binds to the non-ubiquitinated gap junction protein connexin43 (Cx43) and regulates the turnover of Cx43 through the proteasomal pathway. PLIC proteins contain an N-terminal Ubl domain that is responsible for the binding of Ub-interacting motifs (UIMs) expressed by proteasomes and endocytic adaptors, and C-terminal Ub-associated (UBA) domain that interacts with Ub chains present on proteins destined for proteasomal degradation. In addition, mammalian PLIC2 proteins have an extra collagen-like motif region, which is absent in other PLIC proteins and the yeast Dsk2 protein.	73.0

FAT10, also termed ubiquitin D (UBD), or diubiquitin, is a cytokine-inducible ubiquitin-like (Ubl) modifer that is highly expressed in the thymus, and targets substrates covalently for 26S proteasomal degradation. It is also associated with cancer development, antigen processing and antimicrobial defense, chromosomal stability and cell cycle regulation. FAT10 is presented on immune cells and under the inflammatory conditions, is synergistically induced by interferon gamma (IFNgamma) and tumor necrosis factor (TNFalpha) in the non-immune (liver parenchymal) cells. FAT10 contains two Ubl domains. The family corresponds to the first Ubl domain of FAT10. Some family members contain only one Ubl domain.	74.0

UHRF1, also termed inverted CCAAT box-binding protein of 90 kDa, or nuclear protein 95, or nuclear zinc finger protein Np95 (Np95), or RING finger protein 106, or transcription factor ICBP90, or E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase UHRF1, is a unique chromatin effector protein that integrates the recognition of both histone PTMs and DNA methylation. It is essential for cell proliferation and plays a critical role in the development and progression of many human carcinomas, such as laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, gastric cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, and breast cancer. UHRF1 can acts as a transcriptional repressor through its binding to histone H3 when it is unmodified at Arg2. Its overexpression in human lung fibroblasts results in downregulation of expression of the tumor suppressor pRB. It also plays a role in transcriptional repression of the cell cycle regulator p21.Moreover, UHRF1-dependent repression of factors can facilitate the G1-S transition. It interacts with Tat-interacting protein of 60 kDa (TIP60) and induces degradation-independent ubiquitination ofTIP60. It is also an N-methylpurine DNA glycosylase (MPG)-interacting protein that binds MPG in a p53status-independent manner in the DNA base excision repair (BER) pathway. In addition, UHRF1 functions as an epigenetic regulator that is important for multiple aspects of epigenetic regulation, including maintenance of DNA methylation patterns and recognition of various histone modifications. UHRF1 contains an N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain (Ubl), a tandem Tudor domain (TTD), a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger, a SET and RING finger associated (SRA) domain, and a C-terminal RING-finger domain. It specifically binds to hemimethylated DNA, double-stranded CpG dinucleotides, and recruits the maintenance methyltransferase DNMT1 to its hemimethylated DNA substrate through its SRA domain. UHRF1-dependent H3K23 ubiquitination has an essential role in maintenance DNA methylation and replication. The tandem Tudor domain directs UHRF1 binding to the heterochromatin mark histone H3K9me3 and the PHD finger targets UHRF1 to unmodified histone H3 in euchromatic regions. The RING-finger domain exhibits both autocatalytic E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase activity and activity against histone H3 and DNMT1.	74.0

OASL, also termed 2'-5'-OAS-related protein (2'-5'-OAS-RP), or 59 kDa 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthase-like protein, or thyroid receptor-interacting protein 14, or TR-interacting protein 14 (TRIP-14), or p59 OASL (p59OASL), is an interferon (IFN)-induced antiviral protein that plays an important role in the IFNs-mediated antiviral signaling pathway. It inhibits respiratory syncytial virus replication and is targeted by the viral nonstructural protein 1 (NS1). It also displays antiviral activity against encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) via an alternative antiviral pathway independent of RNase L. Moreover, OASL does not have 2'-5'-OAS activity, but can bind double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to enhance RIG-I signaling. OASL belongs to the 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthase (OAS) family. While each member of this family has a conserved N-terminal OAS catalytic domain, only OASL has two tandem C-terminal ubiquitin-like (Ubl) repeats, which is required for its antiviral activity. This family corresponds to the first Ubl domain.	75.0

UBTD2, also termed dendritic cell-derived ubiquitin-like protein (DC-UbP), or ubiquitin-like protein SB72, is a potential ubiquitin shuttle protein firstly identified in dendritic cells and implicated in apoptosis. It binds proteins involved in the ubiquitination pathway and may play an important role in regulating protein ubiquitination and delivery of ubiquitinated substrates in eukaryotic cells. UBTD2 is expressed in tumor cells but not in normal human adult tissue suggesting a role in tumorogenesis. It can potentially regulate the stability of proteins involved in various physiological processes relevant to many disease phenotypes, such as ageing and cancer. UBTD2 reconciles protein ubiquitination and deubiquitination via linking UbE1 and USP5 enzymes.	75.0

It is strongly expressed at the mesencephalon (midbrain) of the embryo in day 12.5 (E12.5) mice and its expression is developmentally regulated. Midnolin plays a role in cellular signaling of adult tissues and regulates glucokinase enzyme activity in pancreatic beta cells. It can also control development via regulation of mRNA transport in cells. Midnolin contains an N-terminal conserved ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain with a beta-grasp Ubl fold, a common structure involved in protein-protein interactions.	70.0

FAF1, also termed UBX domain-containing protein 12 (UBXD12), or UBX domain-containing protein 3A (UBXN3A), belongs to the UBXD family of proteins that contains the ubiquitin (Ub) regulatory domain X (UBX) with a beta-grasp ubiquitin-like (Ubl) fold, but without the C-terminal double glycine motif. The UBX domain is typically located at the carboxyl terminus of proteins, and participates broadly in the regulation of protein degradation. In addition, FAF1 contains two tandem Ubl domains, which show high structural similarity with the UBX domain. FAF1 functions as a cofactor of p97 (also known as VCP or Cdc48), which is a homohexameric AAA ATPase (ATPase associated with a variety of activities) involved in a variety of functions ranging from cell-cycle regulation to membrane fusion and protein degradation. The FAF1-p97 complex inhibits the proteasomal protein degradation in which p97 acts as a co-chaperone. Moreover, FAF1 is an apoptotic signaling molecule that acts downstream in the Fas signal transduction pathway. It interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of Fas, but not to a Fas mutant that is deficient in signal transduction. FAF1 is widely expressed in adult and embryonic tissues, and in tumor cell lines, and is localized not only in the cytoplasm where it interacts with Fas, but also in the nucleus. FAF1 contains phosphorylation sites for protein kinase CK2 within the nuclear targeting domain. Phosphorylation influences nuclear localization of FAF1 but does not affect its potentiation of Fas-induced apoptosis. Other functions have also been attributed to FAF1. It inhibits nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) by interfering with the nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit. Although the precise role of FAF1 in the ubiquitination pathway remains unclear, FAF1 interacts with valosin-containing protein (VCP), which is involved in the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway. The family corresponds to the first Ubl domain.	73.0

The Ubl domain may have an adaptor role in ubiquitin (Ub)-signaling by mediating protein-protein interaction. Ubl proteins have a beta-grasp Ubl fold and attach to other proteins in a Ubl manner with biochemically distinct roles. The ankyrin repeats have been identified in numerous proteins with diverse functions. The family corresponds to the first Ubl domain.	79.0

HR23A, also termed RAD23A, is a DNA repair protein that binds to 19S subunit of the 26S proteasome and shuttles ubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome for degradation, which is required for efficient nucleotide excision repair (NER), a primary mechanism for removing UV-induced DNA lesions. HR23A also plays a critical role in the interaction of HIV-1 viral protein R (Vpr) with the proteasome, especially facilitating Vpr to promote protein poly-ubiquitination. HR23A contains an N-terminal ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain that binds proteasomes and two C-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains that bind ubiquitin or multi-ubiquitinated substrates. In addition, it has a XPC protein-binding domain that might be necessary for its efficient NER function.	76.0

HOIL-1, also termed RBCK1, or HOIL-1L, or RanBP-type and C3HC4-type zinc finger-containing protein 1, HBV-associated factor 4, or Hepatitis B virus X-associated protein 4, or RING finger protein 54 (RNF54), or ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 7-interacting protein 3, or UbcM4-interacting protein 28 (UIP28), together with E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase RNF31 (also known as HOIP) and SHANK-associated RH domain interacting protein (SHARPIN), forms the E3-ligase complex (also known as linear-ubiquitin-chain assembly complex LUBAC) that regulates NF-kappaB activity and apoptosis through conjugation of linear polyubiquitin chains to NF-kappaB essential modulator (also known as NEMO or IKBKG). HOIL-1 plays a crucial role in TNF-alpha-mediated NF-kappaB activation. It also functions as an ubiquitin-protein ligase E3 that interacts with not only PKCbeta but also PKCzeta. It can recognize heme-oxidized IRP2 (iron regulatory protein2) and is thought to affect the turnover of oxidatively damaged proteins. HOIL-1 contains an N-terminal ubiqutin-like (UBL) domain and an Npl4 zinc-finger (NZF) domain, which regulate the interaction with the LUBAC subunit RNF31 and ubiquitin, respectively. The NZF domain belongs to RanBP2-type zinc finger (zf-RanBP2) domain superfamily. In addition, HOIL-1 has a RBR domain that was previously known as RING-BetweenRING-RING domain or TRIAD [two RING fingers and a DRIL (double RING finger linked)] domain. Based on current understanding of the structural biology of RBR ligases, the nomenclature of RBR has been corrected as RING-BRcat (benign-catalytic)-Rcat (required-for-catalysis) recently. The RBR (RING1-BRcat-Rcat) domain use an auto-inhibitory mechanism to modulate ubiquitination activity, as well as a hybrid mechanism that combines aspects from both RING and HECT E3 ligase function to facilitate the ubiquitination reaction.	81.0

HR23B, also termed xeroderma pigmentosum group C (XPC) repair-complementing complex 58 kDa protein (p58), is tightly complexed with XPC protein to form the XPC-HR23B complex. Although it displays a high affinity for both single- and double-stranded DNA, the XPC-HR23B complex functions as a global genome repair (GGR)-specific repair factor that is specifically involved in global genome but not transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (NER). HR23B also interacts specifically with S5a subunit of the human 26S proteasome, and plays an important role in shuttling ubiquitinated cargo proteins to the proteasome. HR23B contains an N-terminal ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain that binds proteasomes and two C-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains that bind ubiquitin or multi-ubiquitinated substrates.

This family includes TECR and many TECR-like proteins, such as TECRL. TECR, also termed very-long-chain enoyl-CoA reductase, or synaptic glycoprotein SC2, or TER, or GPSN2, is a synaptic glycoprotein that catalyzes the fourth reaction in the synthesis of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) which is the reduction step of the microsomal fatty acyl-elongation process. Diseases involving perturbations to normal synthesis and degradation of VLCFA (e.g. adrenoleukodystrophy and Zellweger syndrome) have significant neurological consequences. The mammalian TECR P182L mutation causes nonsyndromic mental retardation. Deletion of the yeast TECR (TSC13) homolog is lethal. TECR contains an N-terminal ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain with a beta-grasp Ubl fold, a common structure involved in protein-protein interactions, as well as a C-terminal catalytic domain. TECRL, also termed steroid 5-alpha-reductase 2-like 2 protein (SRD5A2L2), is associated with life-threatening inherited arrhythmias displaying features of both long QT syndrome (LQTS) and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). Both TECR and TECRL contain an N-terminal Ubl domain with a beta-grasp Ubl fold, and a C-terminal catalytic domain.	77.0

The family includes four Arabidopsis BAG family proteins (AtBAG1, AtBAG2, AtBAG3, AtBAG4) that have very similar domain organizations with a ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain in the N-terminus and a BAG domain in the C-terminus. They may function as co-chaperones that regulate diverse cellular pathways, such as programmed cell death and stress responses. AtBAG1, AtBAG3, and AtBAG4 are predicted to localize in the cytoplasm, but the localization of AtBAG2 is the microbody. AtBAG4 can interact with Hsc70. The overexpression of AtBAG4 in tobacco plants confers tolerance to a wide range of abiotic stresses such as UV light, cold, oxidants, and salt treatments.	70.0

UBL5, known as Hub1 in yeast, is an atypical ubiquitin-like (Ubl) post-translational modifier that contains a conserved Ubl domain with a beta-grasp Ubl fold. At the C-terminal end of its Ubl fold is a di-tyrosine motif followed by a single variable residue instead of the characteristic di-glycine found in all other Ubl modifiers, and thus UBL5 does not form covalent conjugates with cellular proteins. The yeast Hub1p binds non-covalently to the HIND element of spliceosomal protein Snu66p (Snu66p is termed SART1 in mammals) and modifies the spliceosome by this unconventional Ubl modifier. In higher eukaryotes, UBL5/Hub1 plays a role in modulating pre-mRNA splicing. It also is required for signaling in the mitochondrial unfolded protein response, through interaction with the transcription factor DVE-1 and upregulation of chaperone genes in response to mitochondrial stress. Moreover, UBL5 functions as a factor that directly binds to and stabilizes FANCI, and promotes the functionality of the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway.	71.0

Plasmids may be maintained stably in bacterial populations through the action of addiction modules, in which a toxin and antidote are encoded in a cassette on the plasmid. In any daughter cell that lacks the plasmid, the toxin persists and is lethal after the antidote protein is depleted. Toxin/antitoxin pairs are also found on main chromosomes, and likely represent selfish DNA. Sequences in the seed for this alignment all were found adjacent to toxin genes. The resulting model appears to describe a narrower set of proteins than pfam04221, although many in the scope of this model are not obviously paired with toxin proteins. Several toxin/antitoxin pairs may occur in a single species. [Cellular processes, Toxin production and resistance, Mobile and extrachromosomal element functions, Other]	84.0

The function of this family is uncertain. The bacterial members are about 60-70 amino acids in length and the eukaryotic examples are about 120 amino acids in length. The C-terminus contains the strongest conservation. Trm112p is required for tRNA methylation in S. cerevisiae and is found in complexes with 2 tRNA methylases (TRM9 and TRM11) also with putative methyltransferase YDR140W. The zinc-finger protein Ynr046w is plurifunctional and a component of the eRF1 methyltransferase in yeast. The crystal structure of Ynr046w has been determined to 1.7 A resolution. It comprises a zinc-binding domain built from both the N- and C-terminal sequences and an inserted domain, absent from bacterial and archaeal orthologs of the protein, composed of three alpha-helices.	44.0	CL0167	Zn_Beta_Ribbon	Trm112p-like protein

This short domain consists of a helix-turn-helix structure, which can bind to several types of RNA. It is found in the ribosomal protein S15, the influenza A viral nonstructural protein (NSA) and in several eukaryotic aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRSs), where it occurs as a single or a repeated unit. It is involved in both protein-RNA interactions by binding tRNA and protein-protein interactions in the formation of tRNA-synthetases into multienzyme complexes. While this domain lacks significant sequence similarity between the subgroups in which it is found, they share similar electrostatic surface potentials and thus are likely to bind to RNA via the same mechanism.	46.0

Subunit c (also called subunit 9, or proteolipid) of the Fo complex of F-ATP synthase. The F-ATP synthase (also called FoF1-ATPase) consists of two structural domains: the F1 (factor one) complex containing the soluble catalytic core, and the Fo (oligomycin sensitive factor) complex containing the membrane proton channel, linked together by a central stalk and a peripheral stalk. F1 is composed of alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and epsilon subunits with a stoichiometry of 3:3:1:1:1, while Fo consists of the three subunits a, b, and c (1:2:10-14). An oligomeric ring of 10-14 c subunits (c-ring) make up the Fo rotor. The flux of protons though the ATPase channel (Fo) drives the rotation of the c-ring, which in turn is coupled to the rotation of the F1 complex gamma subunit rotor due to the permanent binding between the gamma and epsilon subunits of F1 and the c-ring of Fo. The F-ATP synthases are primarily found in the inner membranes of eukaryotic mitochondria, in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts, or in the plasma membranes of bacteria. The F-ATP synthases are the primary producers of ATP, using the proton gradient generated by oxidative phosphorylation (mitochondria) or photosynthesis (chloroplasts). Alternatively, under conditions of low driving force, ATP synthases function as ATPases, thus generating a transmembrane proton or Na(+) gradient at the expense of energy derived from ATP hydrolysis. This group also includes F-ATP synthase that has also been found in the archaea Methanosarcina acetivorans.	65.0

Subunit c of the Fo/Vo/Ao complex is the main transmembrane subunit of F-, V- or A-type family of ATP synthases with rotary motors. These ion-transporting rotary ATP synthases are composed of two linked multi-subunit complexes: the F1, V1, and A1 complexes contains three copies each of the alpha and beta subunits that form the soluble catalytic core, which is involved in ATP synthesis/hydrolysis, and the Fo, Vo, or Ao (oligomycin sensitive) complex that forms the membrane-embedded proton pore. The F-ATP synthases (also called FoF1-ATPases) are found in the inner membranes of eukaryotic mitochondria, in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts, or in the plasma membranes of bacteria. F-ATPases are the primary producers of ATP, using the proton gradient generated by oxidative phosphorylation (mitochondria) or photosynthesis (chloroplasts). Alternatively, under conditions of low driving force, ATP synthases function as ATPases, thus generating a transmembrane proton or Na(+) gradient at the expense of energy  derived from ATP hydrolysis. The A-ATP synthase (AoA1-ATPases) is exclusively found in archaea and function like F-ATP synthase. Structurally, however, the A-ATP synthase is more closely related to the V-ATP synthase (vacuolar VoV1-ATPase), which is a proton-translocating ATPase responsible for acidification of eukaryotic intracellular compartments and for ATP synthesis in archaea and some eubacteria. Collectively, F-, V-, and A-type synthases can function in both ATP synthesis and hydrolysis modes.	65.0

A brief description of this multisubunit enzyme complex: F1 and F0 represent two major clusters of subunits. The functional role of subunit c, which is the part of F0 cluster, has been delineated in-vitro reconstitution experiments. Overall experimental proof exists that demonstrate the electrochemical gradient is converted into a rotational torque that leads to ATP synthesis.

Vo/Ao-ATP synthase subunit c. The V- and A-type family of ATPases are composed of two linked multi-subunit complexes: the V1 and A1 complexes contain three copies each of the alpha and beta subunits that form the soluble catalytic core, which is involved in ATP synthesis/hydrolysis, and the Vo or Ao complex that forms the membrane-embedded proton pore. The A-ATP synthase (AoA1-ATPases) is exclusively found in archaea and functions like the F-ATP synthase. Structurally, however, the A-ATP synthase is more closely related to the V-ATP synthase (vacuolar VoV1-ATPase), which is a proton-translocating ATPase responsible for acidification of eukaryotic intracellular compartments and for ATP synthesis in archaea and some eubacteria. The V- and A-type synthases can function in both ATP synthesis and hydrolysis modes. The V1 complex consists of three A and three B subunits, two G subunits plus the C, D, E, F, and H subunits. The Vo complex consists of five different subunits: a, c, c', c'', and d. The Ao/A1 complexes are composed of nine subunits in a stoichiometry of A(3):B(3):C:D:E:F:H(2):a:c(x). ATP is synthesized on the A3:B3 hexamer and the energy released during that process is transferred to the Ao complex, which consists of the C-terminal segment of subunit a and subunit c.	62.0

This short domain consists of a helix-turn-helix structure, which can bind to several types of RNA. It is found in the ribosomal protein S15, the influenza A viral nonstructural protein (NSA) and in several eukaryotic aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRSs), where it occurs as a single or a repeated unit. It is involved in both protein-RNA interactions by binding tRNA and protein-protein interactions in the formation of tRNA-synthetases into multienzyme complexes. While this domain lacks significant sequence similarity between the subgroups in which it is found, they share similar electrostatic surface potentials and thus are likely to bind to RNA via the same mechanism.	46.0

CSP's include the major cold-shock proteins CspA and CspB in bacteria and the eukaryotic gene regulatory factor Y-box protein. CSP expression is up-regulated by an abrupt drop in growth temperature. CSP's are also expressed under normal condition at lower level. The function of cold-shock proteins is not fully understood. They preferentially bind poly-pyrimidine region of single-stranded RNA and DNA.  CSP's are thought to bind mRNA and regulate ribosomal translation, mRNA degradation, and  the rate of transcription termination. The human Y-box protein, which contains a CSD, regulates transcription and translation of genes that contain the Y-box sequence in their promoters. This specific ssDNA-binding properties of CSD are required for the binding of Y-box protein to the promoter's Y-box sequence, thereby regulating transcription.	65.0

The gene symbol cspD may have been used idependently for other subfamilies of cold shock domain proteins, such as for B. subtilis CspD. These proteins typically are shorter than 70 amino acids. In E. coli, CspD is a stress response protein induced in stationary phase. This homodimer binds single-stranded DNA and appears to inhibit DNA replication.

IF1 contains an S1-like RNA-binding domain, which is found in a wide variety of RNA-associated proteins. Translation initiation includes a number of interrelated steps preceding the formation of the first peptide bond. In Escherichia coli, the initiation mechanism requires, in addition to mRNA, fMet-tRNA, and ribosomal subunits,  the presence of three additional proteins (initiation factors IF1, IF2, and IF3) and at least one GTP molecule. The three initiation factors influence both the kinetics and the stability of ternary complex formation. IF1 is the smallest of the three factors. IF1 enhances the rate of 70S ribosome subunit association and dissociation and the interaction of 30S ribosomal subunit with IF2 and IF3. It stimulates 30S complex formation. In addition, by binding to the A-site of the 30S ribosomal subunit, IF1 may contribute to the fidelity of the selection of the initiation site of the mRNA.	64.0

S1-like RNA-binding domains are found in a wide variety of RNA-associated proteins. IF1A is essential for translation initiation. eIF1A acts synergistically with eIF1 to mediate assembly of ribosomal initiation complexes at the initiation codon and maintain the accuracy of this process by recognizing and destabilizing aberrant preinitiation complexes from the mRNA. Without eIF1A and eIF1, 43S ribosomal preinitiation complexes can bind to the cap-proximal region, but are unable to reach the initiation codon. eIF1a also enhances the formation of 5'-terminal complexes in the presence of other translation initiation factors. This protein family is only found in eukaryotes and archaea.	77.0

CSP's include the major cold-shock proteins CspA and CspB in bacteria and the eukaryotic gene regulatory factor Y-box protein. CSP expression is up-regulated by an abrupt drop in growth temperature. CSP's are also expressed under normal condition at lower level. The function of cold-shock proteins is not fully understood. They preferentially bind poly-pyrimidine region of single-stranded RNA and DNA.  CSP's are thought to bind mRNA and regulate ribosomal translation, mRNA degradation, and  the rate of transcription termination. The human Y-box protein, which contains a CSD, regulates transcription and translation of genes that contain the Y-box sequence in their promoters. This specific ssDNA-binding properties of CSD are required for the binding of Y-box protein to the promoter's Y-box sequence, thereby regulating transcription.	65.0

This model represents what appears to be a phylogenetically distinct clade, containing E. coli CspD (SP|P24245) and related proteobacterial proteins within the larger family of cold shock domain proteins described by pfam00313. The gene symbol cspD may have been used idependently for other subfamilies of cold shock domain proteins, such as for B. subtilis CspD. These proteins typically are shorter than 70 amino acids. In E. coli, CspD is a stress response protein induced in stationary phase. This homodimer binds single-stranded DNA and appears to inhibit DNA replication.

A SF is a dissociable subunit of RNA polymerase, it directs bacterial or plastid core RNA polymerase to specific promoter elements located upstream of transcription initiation points. The SR4 of Ec sigma70 and other essential primary SFs contact promoter sequences located 35 base-pairs upstream of the initiation point, recognizing a 6-base-pair -35 consensus TTGACA.  Sigma70 related SFs also include SFs which are dispensable for bacterial cell growth for example Ec sigmaS, SFs which activate regulons in response to a specific signal for example heat-shock Ec sigmaH, and a group of SFs which includes the extracytoplasmic function (ECF) SFs and is typified by Ec sigmaE which contains SR2 and -4 only. ECF SFs direct the transcription of genes that regulate various responses including periplasmic stress and pathogenesis.   Ec sigmaE SR4 also contacts the -35 element, but recognizes a different consensus (a 7-base-pair GGAACTT).  Plant SFs recognize sigma70 type promoters and direct transcription of the major plastid RNA polymerase, plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP).	55.0

This subfamily includes HU and HU-like domains. HU is a conserved nucleoid-associated protein (NAP) which binds non-specifically to duplex DNA with a particular preference for targeting nicked and bent DNA. It is highly basic and contributes to chromosomal compaction and maintenance of negative supercoiling, thus often referred to as histone-like protein. HU can induce DNA bends, condense DNA in a fiber and also interact with single stranded DNA. It contains two homologous subunits, alpha and beta, typically forming homodimers (alpha-alpha and beta-beta), except in E. coli and other enterobacteria, which form heterodimers (alpha-beta). In E. coli, HU binds uniformly to the chromosome, with a preference for damaged or distorted DNA structures and can introduce negative supercoils into closed circular DNA in the presence of topoisomerase I. Anabaena HU (AHU) shows preference for A/T-rich region in the center of its DNA binding site.	86.0

This subfamily consists of the alpha subunit of integration host factor (IHF) and IHF-like domains. IHF is a nucleoid-associated protein (NAP) that binds and sharply bends many DNA targets in a sequence specific manner. It is a heterodimeric protein composed of two highly homologous subunits IHFA (IHF-alpha) and IHFB (IHF-beta). It is known to act as a transcription factor at many gene regulatory regions in E. coli. IHF is an essential cofactor in phage lambda site-specific recombination, having an architectural role during assembly of specialized nucleoprotein structures (snups). IHF is also involved in formation as well as maintenance of bacterial biofilms since it is found in complex with extracellular DNA (eDNA) within the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) matrix of many biofilms.	88.0

This family includes integration host factor (IHF) and HU, also called type II DNA-binding proteins (DNABII), which are small dimeric proteins that specifically bind the DNA minor groove, inducing large bends in the DNA and serving as architectural factors in a variety of cellular processes such as recombination, initiation of replication/transcription and gene regulation. IHF binds DNA in a sequence specific manner while HU displays little or no sequence preference. IHF homologs are usually heterodimers, while HU homologs are typically homodimers (except HU heterodimers from E. coli and other enterobacteria). HU is highly basic and contributes to chromosomal compaction and maintenance of negative supercoiling, thus often referred to as histone-like protein. IHF is an essential cofactor in phage lambda site-specific recombination, having an architectural role during assembly of specialized nucleoprotein structures (snups). Bacillus phage SPO1-encoded transcription factor 1 (TF1) is another related type II DNA-binding protein. Like IHF, TF1 binds DNA specifically and bends DNA sharply.	85.0

Subunit c (also called subunit 9, or proteolipid) of the Fo complex of F-ATP synthase. The F-ATP synthase (also called FoF1-ATPase) consists of two structural domains: the F1 (factor one) complex containing the soluble catalytic core, and the Fo (oligomycin sensitive factor) complex containing the membrane proton channel, linked together by a central stalk and a peripheral stalk. F1 is composed of alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and epsilon subunits with a stoichiometry of 3:3:1:1:1, while Fo consists of the three subunits a, b, and c (1:2:10-14). An oligomeric ring of 10-14 c subunits (c-ring) make up the Fo rotor. The flux of protons though the ATPase channel (Fo) drives the rotation of the c-ring, which in turn is coupled to the rotation of the F1 complex gamma subunit rotor due to the permanent binding between the gamma and epsilon subunits of F1 and the c-ring of Fo. The F-ATP synthases are primarily found in the inner membranes of eukaryotic mitochondria, in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts, or in the plasma membranes of bacteria. The F-ATP synthases are the primary producers of ATP, using the proton gradient generated by oxidative phosphorylation (mitochondria) or photosynthesis (chloroplasts). Alternatively, under conditions of low driving force, ATP synthases function as ATPases, thus generating a transmembrane proton or Na(+) gradient at the expense of energy derived from ATP hydrolysis. This group also includes F-ATP synthase that has also been found in the archaea Methanosarcina acetivorans.	65.0

Subunit c of the Fo/Vo/Ao complex is the main transmembrane subunit of F-, V- or A-type family of ATP synthases with rotary motors. These ion-transporting rotary ATP synthases are composed of two linked multi-subunit complexes: the F1, V1, and A1 complexes contains three copies each of the alpha and beta subunits that form the soluble catalytic core, which is involved in ATP synthesis/hydrolysis, and the Fo, Vo, or Ao (oligomycin sensitive) complex that forms the membrane-embedded proton pore. The F-ATP synthases (also called FoF1-ATPases) are found in the inner membranes of eukaryotic mitochondria, in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts, or in the plasma membranes of bacteria. F-ATPases are the primary producers of ATP, using the proton gradient generated by oxidative phosphorylation (mitochondria) or photosynthesis (chloroplasts). Alternatively, under conditions of low driving force, ATP synthases function as ATPases, thus generating a transmembrane proton or Na(+) gradient at the expense of energy  derived from ATP hydrolysis. The A-ATP synthase (AoA1-ATPases) is exclusively found in archaea and function like F-ATP synthase. Structurally, however, the A-ATP synthase is more closely related to the V-ATP synthase (vacuolar VoV1-ATPase), which is a proton-translocating ATPase responsible for acidification of eukaryotic intracellular compartments and for ATP synthesis in archaea and some eubacteria. Collectively, F-, V-, and A-type synthases can function in both ATP synthesis and hydrolysis modes.	65.0

This model describes the subunit c in F1/F0-ATP synthase, a membrane associated multisubunit complex found in bacteria and organelles of higher eukaryotes, namely, mitochondria and chloroplast. This enzyme is principally involved in the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate by coupling the energy derived from the proton electrochemical gradient across the biological membrane. A brief description of this multisubunit enzyme complex: F1 and F0 represent two major clusters of subunits. The functional role of subunit c, which is the part of F0 cluster, has been delineated in-vitro reconstitution experiments. Overall experimental proof exists that demonstrate the electrochemical gradient is converted into a rotational torque that leads to ATP synthesis.

IF1 contains an S1-like RNA-binding domain, which is found in a wide variety of RNA-associated proteins. Translation initiation includes a number of interrelated steps preceding the formation of the first peptide bond. In Escherichia coli, the initiation mechanism requires, in addition to mRNA, fMet-tRNA, and ribosomal subunits,  the presence of three additional proteins (initiation factors IF1, IF2, and IF3) and at least one GTP molecule. The three initiation factors influence both the kinetics and the stability of ternary complex formation. IF1 is the smallest of the three factors. IF1 enhances the rate of 70S ribosome subunit association and dissociation and the interaction of 30S ribosomal subunit with IF2 and IF3. It stimulates 30S complex formation. In addition, by binding to the A-site of the 30S ribosomal subunit, IF1 may contribute to the fidelity of the selection of the initiation site of the mRNA.	64.0

This model represents a number of putative excisionases and related proteins from temperate phage, plasmids, and transposons, as well as DNA binding domains of other proteins, such as a DNA modification methylase. This model identifies mostly small proteins and N-terminal regions of large proteins, but some proteins appear to have two copies. This domain appears similar, in both sequence and predicted secondary structure (PSIPRED) to the MerR family of transcriptional regulators (pfam00376). [Unknown function, General]	49.0

CSP's include the major cold-shock proteins CspA and CspB in bacteria and the eukaryotic gene regulatory factor Y-box protein. CSP expression is up-regulated by an abrupt drop in growth temperature. CSP's are also expressed under normal condition at lower level. The function of cold-shock proteins is not fully understood. They preferentially bind poly-pyrimidine region of single-stranded RNA and DNA.  CSP's are thought to bind mRNA and regulate ribosomal translation, mRNA degradation, and  the rate of transcription termination. The human Y-box protein, which contains a CSD, regulates transcription and translation of genes that contain the Y-box sequence in their promoters. This specific ssDNA-binding properties of CSD are required for the binding of Y-box protein to the promoter's Y-box sequence, thereby regulating transcription.	65.0

This model represents what appears to be a phylogenetically distinct clade, containing E. coli CspD (SP|P24245) and related proteobacterial proteins within the larger family of cold shock domain proteins described by pfam00313. The gene symbol cspD may have been used idependently for other subfamilies of cold shock domain proteins, such as for B. subtilis CspD. These proteins typically are shorter than 70 amino acids. In E. coli, CspD is a stress response protein induced in stationary phase. This homodimer binds single-stranded DNA and appears to inhibit DNA replication.

This domain model summarizes a family of DNA-binding domains unique to bacteria and represented by the Hin protein of Salmonella. The basic HTH domain is a simple fold comprised of three core helices that form a right-handed helical bundle. The principal DNA-protein interface is formed by the third helix, the recognition helix, inserting itself into the major groove of the DNA. A diverse array of HTH domains participate in a variety of functions that depend on their DNA-binding properties. HTH_Hin represents one of the simplest versions of the HTH domains; the characterization of homologous relationships between various sequence-diverse HTH domain families remains difficult. The Hin recombinase induces the site-specific inversion of a chromosomal DNA segment containing a promoter, which controls the alternate expression of two genes by reversibly switching orientation. The Hin recombinase consists of a single polypeptide chain containing a C-terminal DNA-binding domain (HTH_Hin) and a catalytic domain.	42.0

This model describes the subunit c in F1/F0-ATP synthase, a membrane associated multisubunit complex found in bacteria and organelles of higher eukaryotes, namely, mitochondria and chloroplast. This enzyme is principally involved in the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate by coupling the energy derived from the proton electrochemical gradient across the biological membrane. A brief description of this multisubunit enzyme complex: F1 and F0 represent two major clusters of subunits. The functional role of subunit c, which is the part of F0 cluster, has been delineated in-vitro reconstitution experiments. Overall experimental proof exists that demonstrate the electrochemical gradient is converted into a rotational torque that leads to ATP synthesis.

Subunit c (also called subunit 9, or proteolipid) of the Fo complex of F-ATP synthase. The F-ATP synthase (also called FoF1-ATPase) consists of two structural domains: the F1 (factor one) complex containing the soluble catalytic core, and the Fo (oligomycin sensitive factor) complex containing the membrane proton channel, linked together by a central stalk and a peripheral stalk. F1 is composed of alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and epsilon subunits with a stoichiometry of 3:3:1:1:1, while Fo consists of the three subunits a, b, and c (1:2:10-14). An oligomeric ring of 10-14 c subunits (c-ring) make up the Fo rotor. The flux of protons though the ATPase channel (Fo) drives the rotation of the c-ring, which in turn is coupled to the rotation of the F1 complex gamma subunit rotor due to the permanent binding between the gamma and epsilon subunits of F1 and the c-ring of Fo. The F-ATP synthases are primarily found in the inner membranes of eukaryotic mitochondria, in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts, or in the plasma membranes of bacteria. The F-ATP synthases are the primary producers of ATP, using the proton gradient generated by oxidative phosphorylation (mitochondria) or photosynthesis (chloroplasts). Alternatively, under conditions of low driving force, ATP synthases function as ATPases, thus generating a transmembrane proton or Na(+) gradient at the expense of energy derived from ATP hydrolysis. This group also includes F-ATP synthase that has also been found in the archaea Methanosarcina acetivorans.	65.0

Subunit c of the Fo/Vo/Ao complex is the main transmembrane subunit of F-, V- or A-type family of ATP synthases with rotary motors. These ion-transporting rotary ATP synthases are composed of two linked multi-subunit complexes: the F1, V1, and A1 complexes contains three copies each of the alpha and beta subunits that form the soluble catalytic core, which is involved in ATP synthesis/hydrolysis, and the Fo, Vo, or Ao (oligomycin sensitive) complex that forms the membrane-embedded proton pore. The F-ATP synthases (also called FoF1-ATPases) are found in the inner membranes of eukaryotic mitochondria, in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts, or in the plasma membranes of bacteria. F-ATPases are the primary producers of ATP, using the proton gradient generated by oxidative phosphorylation (mitochondria) or photosynthesis (chloroplasts). Alternatively, under conditions of low driving force, ATP synthases function as ATPases, thus generating a transmembrane proton or Na(+) gradient at the expense of energy  derived from ATP hydrolysis. The A-ATP synthase (AoA1-ATPases) is exclusively found in archaea and function like F-ATP synthase. Structurally, however, the A-ATP synthase is more closely related to the V-ATP synthase (vacuolar VoV1-ATPase), which is a proton-translocating ATPase responsible for acidification of eukaryotic intracellular compartments and for ATP synthesis in archaea and some eubacteria. Collectively, F-, V-, and A-type synthases can function in both ATP synthesis and hydrolysis modes.	65.0

This short domain consists of a helix-turn-helix structure, which can bind to several types of RNA. It is found in the ribosomal protein S15, the influenza A viral nonstructural protein (NSA) and in several eukaryotic aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRSs), where it occurs as a single or a repeated unit. It is involved in both protein-RNA interactions by binding tRNA and protein-protein interactions in the formation of tRNA-synthetases into multienzyme complexes. While this domain lacks significant sequence similarity between the subgroups in which it is found, they share similar electrostatic surface potentials and thus are likely to bind to RNA via the same mechanism.	46.0

Members of this group are chromodomains or chromo shadow domains; these are SH3-fold-beta-barrel domains of the chromo-like superfamily. Chromodomains lack the first strand of the SH3-fold-beta-barrel, this first strand is altered by insertion in the chromo shadow domains. The chromodomain is a conserved region of about 50 amino acids, found in a variety of chromosomal proteins, and which appears to play a role in the functional organization of the eukaryotic nucleus. The chromodomain is implicated in the binding, of the proteins in which it is found, to methylated histone tails and maybe RNA. Chromodomain-containing proteins include: i) those having an N-terminal chromodomain followed by a related chromo shadow domain, such as Drosophila and human heterochromatin protein Su(var)205 (HP1), and mammalian modifier 1 and 2; ii) those having a single chromodomain, such as Drosophila protein Polycomb (Pc), mammalian modifier 3, human Mi-2 autoantigen, and several yeast and Caenorhabditis elegans proteins of unknown function; iii) those having paired tandem chromodomains, such as mammalian DNA-binding/helicase proteins CHD-1 to CHD-4 and yeast protein CHD1; (iv) and elongation factor eEF3, a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of proteins, that serves an essential function in the translation cycle of fungi. eEF3 is a soluble factor lacking a transmembrane domain and having two ABC domains arranged in tandem, with a unique chromodomain inserted within the ABC2 domain.	50.0

Repeat 2 of tandem CHRomatin Organization Modifier (chromo) domains, found in CHD (chromodomain helicase DNA-binding) proteins such as mammalian helicase DNA-binding proteins CHD1 to CHD9, and yeast protein CHD1. The CHD proteins belong to the SNF2 superfamily of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers and contain two signature motifs: a pair of chromodomains located in the N-terminal region, and the SNF2-like ATPase domain located in the central region of the protein. CHD chromatin remodelers are important regulators of transcription and play critical roles during developmental processes. The N-terminal chromodomains of CHD1 have been shown to guard against sliding hexasomes. Mutations in the chromodomains of mouse CHD1 result in nuclear redistribution, suggesting that the chromodomain is essential for proper association with chromatin; also, deletion of the chromodomains in the Drosophila melanogaster CHD3-4 homolog impaired nucleosome binding, mobilization, and ATPase functions. A chromodomain is a conserved region of about 50 amino acids, found in a variety of chromosomal proteins, and which appears to play a role in the functional organization of the eukaryotic nucleus. The chromodomain is implicated in the binding, of the proteins in which it is found, to methylated histone tails and maybe RNA. A chromodomain may occur as a single instance, in a tandem arrangement, or followed by a related chromo shadow domain.	54.0

Subunit c (also called subunit 9, or proteolipid) of the Fo complex of F-ATP synthase. The F-ATP synthase (also called FoF1-ATPase) consists of two structural domains: the F1 (factor one) complex containing the soluble catalytic core, and the Fo (oligomycin sensitive factor) complex containing the membrane proton channel, linked together by a central stalk and a peripheral stalk. F1 is composed of alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and epsilon subunits with a stoichiometry of 3:3:1:1:1, while Fo consists of the three subunits a, b, and c (1:2:10-14). An oligomeric ring of 10-14 c subunits (c-ring) make up the Fo rotor. The flux of protons though the ATPase channel (Fo) drives the rotation of the c-ring, which in turn is coupled to the rotation of the F1 complex gamma subunit rotor due to the permanent binding between the gamma and epsilon subunits of F1 and the c-ring of Fo. The F-ATP synthases are primarily found in the inner membranes of eukaryotic mitochondria, in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts, or in the plasma membranes of bacteria. The F-ATP synthases are the primary producers of ATP, using the proton gradient generated by oxidative phosphorylation (mitochondria) or photosynthesis (chloroplasts). Alternatively, under conditions of low driving force, ATP synthases function as ATPases, thus generating a transmembrane proton or Na(+) gradient at the expense of energy derived from ATP hydrolysis. This group also includes F-ATP synthase that has also been found in the archaea Methanosarcina acetivorans.	65.0

Subunit c of the Fo/Vo/Ao complex is the main transmembrane subunit of F-, V- or A-type family of ATP synthases with rotary motors. These ion-transporting rotary ATP synthases are composed of two linked multi-subunit complexes: the F1, V1, and A1 complexes contains three copies each of the alpha and beta subunits that form the soluble catalytic core, which is involved in ATP synthesis/hydrolysis, and the Fo, Vo, or Ao (oligomycin sensitive) complex that forms the membrane-embedded proton pore. The F-ATP synthases (also called FoF1-ATPases) are found in the inner membranes of eukaryotic mitochondria, in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts, or in the plasma membranes of bacteria. F-ATPases are the primary producers of ATP, using the proton gradient generated by oxidative phosphorylation (mitochondria) or photosynthesis (chloroplasts). Alternatively, under conditions of low driving force, ATP synthases function as ATPases, thus generating a transmembrane proton or Na(+) gradient at the expense of energy  derived from ATP hydrolysis. The A-ATP synthase (AoA1-ATPases) is exclusively found in archaea and function like F-ATP synthase. Structurally, however, the A-ATP synthase is more closely related to the V-ATP synthase (vacuolar VoV1-ATPase), which is a proton-translocating ATPase responsible for acidification of eukaryotic intracellular compartments and for ATP synthesis in archaea and some eubacteria. Collectively, F-, V-, and A-type synthases can function in both ATP synthesis and hydrolysis modes.	65.0

This enzyme is principally involved in the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate by coupling the energy derived from the proton electrochemical gradient across the biological membrane. A brief description of this multisubunit enzyme complex: F1 and F0 represent two major clusters of subunits. The functional role of subunit c, which is the part of F0 cluster, has been delineated in-vitro reconstitution experiments. Overall experimental proof exists that demonstrate the electrochemical gradient is converted into a rotational torque that leads to ATP synthesis.

A SF is a dissociable subunit of RNA polymerase, it directs bacterial or plastid core RNA polymerase to specific promoter elements located upstream of transcription initiation points. The SR4 of Ec sigma70 and other essential primary SFs contact promoter sequences located 35 base-pairs upstream of the initiation point, recognizing a 6-base-pair -35 consensus TTGACA.  Sigma70 related SFs also include SFs which are dispensable for bacterial cell growth for example Ec sigmaS, SFs which activate regulons in response to a specific signal for example heat-shock Ec sigmaH, and a group of SFs which includes the extracytoplasmic function (ECF) SFs and is typified by Ec sigmaE which contains SR2 and -4 only. ECF SFs direct the transcription of genes that regulate various responses including periplasmic stress and pathogenesis.   Ec sigmaE SR4 also contacts the -35 element, but recognizes a different consensus (a 7-base-pair GGAACTT).  Plant SFs recognize sigma70 type promoters and direct transcription of the major plastid RNA polymerase, plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP).	55.0

PsaJ can be cross-linked to PsaF and has a single predicted transmembrane domain it has a proposed role in maintaining PsaF in the correct orientation to allow for fast electron transfer from soluble donor proteins to P700+.	37.0			Photosystem I reaction centre subunit IX / PsaJ

IF1 contains an S1-like RNA-binding domain, which is found in a wide variety of RNA-associated proteins. Translation initiation includes a number of interrelated steps preceding the formation of the first peptide bond. In Escherichia coli, the initiation mechanism requires, in addition to mRNA, fMet-tRNA, and ribosomal subunits,  the presence of three additional proteins (initiation factors IF1, IF2, and IF3) and at least one GTP molecule. The three initiation factors influence both the kinetics and the stability of ternary complex formation. IF1 is the smallest of the three factors. IF1 enhances the rate of 70S ribosome subunit association and dissociation and the interaction of 30S ribosomal subunit with IF2 and IF3. It stimulates 30S complex formation. In addition, by binding to the A-site of the 30S ribosomal subunit, IF1 may contribute to the fidelity of the selection of the initiation site of the mRNA.	64.0

S1-like RNA-binding domains are found in a wide variety of RNA-associated proteins. IF1A is essential for translation initiation. eIF1A acts synergistically with eIF1 to mediate assembly of ribosomal initiation complexes at the initiation codon and maintain the accuracy of this process by recognizing and destabilizing aberrant preinitiation complexes from the mRNA. Without eIF1A and eIF1, 43S ribosomal preinitiation complexes can bind to the cap-proximal region, but are unable to reach the initiation codon. eIF1a also enhances the formation of 5'-terminal complexes in the presence of other translation initiation factors. This protein family is only found in eukaryotes and archaea.	77.0

Bacteria and some eukaryotes use two-component signal transduction systems to detect and respond to changes in the environment. The systems consists of a sensor histidine kinase and a response regulator. The former autophosphorylates a histidine residue on detecting an external stimulus. The phosphate is then transferred to an invariant aspartate residue in a highly conserved receiver domain of the response regulator. Phosphorylation activates a variable effector domain of the response regulator, which triggers the cellular response. This C-terminal effector domain belongs to the winged helix-turn-helix family of transcriptional regulators and contains DNA and RNA polymerase binding sites. Several dimers or monomers bind head to tail to small tandem repeats upstream of the genes. The RNA polymerase binding sites interact with the alpha or sigma subunit of RNA polymerase.	89.0

Included in this group is the C-terminus of mitochondrial Elongation factor G1 (mtEFG1) and G2 (mtEFG2) proteins. Eukaryotic cells harbor 2 protein synthesis systems: one localized in the cytoplasm, the other in the mitochondria. Most factors regulating mitochondrial protein synthesis are encoded by nuclear genes, translated in the cytoplasm, and then transported to the mitochondria. The eukaryotic system of elongation factor (EF) components is more complex than that in prokaryotes, with both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial elongation factors and multiple isoforms being expressed in certain species. During the process of peptide synthesis and tRNA site changes, the ribosome is moved along the mRNA a distance equal to one codon with the addition of each amino acid. In bacteria this translocation step is catalyzed by EF-G_GTP, which is hydrolyzed to provide the required energy. Thus, this action releases the uncharged tRNA from the P site and transfers the newly formed peptidyl-tRNA from the A site to the P site. Eukaryotic mtEFG1 proteins show significant homology to bacterial EF-Gs.  Mutants in yeast mtEFG1 have impaired mitochondrial protein synthesis, respiratory defects and a tendency to lose mitochondrial DNA. No clear phenotype has been found for mutants in the yeast homologue of mtEFG2, MEF2.	78.0

This domain includes the carboxyl terminal regions of elongation factors (EFs) bacterial EF-G, eukaryotic and archeal EF-2 and eukaryotic mitochondrial mtEFG1s and mtEFG2s. This group also includes proteins similar to the ribosomal protection proteins Tet(M) and Tet(O), BipA, LepA and, spliceosomal proteins: human 116kD U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) protein (U5-116 kD) and yeast counterpart Snu114p.  This domain adopts a ferredoxin-like fold consisting of an alpha-beta sandwich with anti-parallel beta-sheets, resembling the topology of domain III found in the elongation factors EF-G and eukaryotic EF-2, with which it forms the C-terminal block. The two domains however are not superimposable and domain III lacks some of the characteristics of this domain.  EF-2/EF-G in complex with GTP, promotes the translocation step of translation. During translocation the peptidyl-tRNA is moved from the A site to the P site, the uncharged tRNA from the P site to the E-site and, the mRNA is shifted one codon relative to the ribosome. Tet(M) and Tet(O) mediate Tc resistance. Typical Tcs bind to the ribosome and inhibit the elongation phase of protein synthesis, by inhibiting the occupation of site A by aminoacyl-tRNA. Tet(M) and Tet(O) catalyze the release of tetracycline (Tc) from the ribosome in a GTP-dependent manner.  BipA is a highly conserved protein with global regulatory properties in Escherichia coli. Yeast Snu114p is essential for cell viability and for splicing in vivo. Experiments suggest that GTP binding and probably GTP hydrolysis is important for the function of the U5-116 kD/Snu114p. The function of LepA proteins is unknown.	79.0

The eukaryotic system of elongation factor (EF) components is more complex than that in prokaryotes, with both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial elongation factors and multiple isoforms being expressed in certain species.  Eukaryotic EF-2 operates in the cytosolic protein synthesis machinery of eukaryotes, EF-Gs in protein synthesis in bacteria.  Eukaryotic mtEFG1 proteins show significant homology to bacterial EF-Gs.  Mutants in yeast mtEFG1 have impaired mitochondrial protein synthesis, respiratory defects and a tendency to lose mitochondrial DNA. There are two forms of mtEFG present in mammals (designated mtEFG1s and mtEFG2s) mtEFG2s are not present in this group.	78.0

Yeast Snu114p is essential for cell viability and for splicing in vivo. U5-116 kD binds GTP.  Experiments suggest that GTP binding and probably GTP hydrolysis is important for the function of the U5-116 kD/Snu114p.   In complex with GTP, EF-2 promotes the translocation step of translation. During translocation the peptidyl-tRNA is moved from the A site to the P site, the uncharged tRNA from the P site to the E-site and, the mRNA is shifted one codon relative to the ribosome.	80.0

This domain has homology to the C terminal domains of the elongation factors EF-G and EF-2. Tet(M) and Tet(O) catalyze the release of tetracycline (Tc) from the ribosome in a GTP-dependent manner thereby mediating Tc resistance.  Tcs are broad-spectrum antibiotics.

A member of the ribosome binding GTPase superfamily, BipA is widely distributed in bacteria and plants.  BipA is a highly conserved protein with global regulatory properties in Escherichia coli. BipA is phosphorylated on a tyrosine residue under some cellular conditions. Mutants show altered regulation of some pathways. BipA functions as a translation factor that is required specifically for the expression of the transcriptional modulator Fis.  BipA binds to ribosomes at a site that coincides with that of EF-G and has a GTPase activity that is sensitive to high GDP:GTP ratios and, is stimulated  by 70S ribosomes programmed with mRNA and aminoacylated tRNAs. The growth rate-dependent induction of BipA allows the efficient expression of Fis, thereby modulating a range of downstream processes, including DNA metabolism and type III secretion.	79.0

LepA is ubiquitous in Bacteria and Eukaryota (e.g. Saccharomyces cerevisiae GUF1p), but is missing from Archaea. LepA exhibits significant homology to elongation factors (EFs) Tu and G. The function(s) of the proteins in this family are unknown. The N-terminal domain of LepA is homologous to a domain of similar size found in initiation factor 2 (IF2), and in EF-Tu and EF-G (factors required for translation in Escherichia coli). Two types of phylogenetic tree, rooted by other GTP-binding proteins, suggest that eukaryotic homologs (including S. cerevisiae GUF1) originated within the bacterial LepA family. LepA has never been observed in archaea, and eukaryl LepA is organellar. LepA is therefore a true bacterial GTPase, found only in the bacterial lineage.	80.0

This family includes the C-terminal cupin domain of (S)-Ureidoglycine aminohydrolase (UGlyAH), an enzyme that converts (S)-ureidoglycine into (S)-ureidoglycolate and ammonia, providing the final substrate to the ureide pathway. The ureide pathway has recently been identified as the metabolic route of purine catabolism in plants and some bacteria where, uric acid, which is a major product of the early stage of purine catabolism, is degraded into glyoxylate and ammonia via stepwise reactions by seven different enzymes. Thus, this pathway has a possible physiological role in mobilization of purine ring nitrogen for further assimilation. This enzyme from Arabidopsis thaliana(AtUGlyAH) has been shown to bind a Mn2+ ion,via the C-terminal cupin domain, which acts as a molecular anchor to bind (S)-ureidoglycine, and its binding mode dictates the enantioselectivity of the reaction. The structure of AtUGlyAH shows a bi-cupin fold with a conserved ""jelly roll-like"" beta-barrel fold and an octameric functional unit. Several structural homologs of UGlyAH, including the Escherichia coli ortholog YlbA (also known as GlxB6), also exhibit similar features."	92.0

This superfamily contains proteins similar to the RmlC (dTDP (deoxythymidine diphosphates)-4-dehydrorhamnose 3,5-epimerase)-like cupins. RmlC is a dTDP-sugar isomerase involved in the synthesis of L-rhamnose, a saccharide required for the virulence of some pathogenic bacteria. Cupins are a functionally diverse superfamily originally discovered based on the highly conserved motif found in germin and germin-like proteins. This conserved motif forms a beta-barrel fold found in all of the cupins, giving rise to the name cupin ('cupa' is the Latin term for small barrel). The active site of members of this superfamily is generally located at the center of a conserved barrel and usually includes a metal ion. The different functional classes in this superfamily include single domain bacterial isomerases and epimerases involved in the modification of cell wall carbohydrates, two domain bicupins such as the desiccation-tolerant seed storage globulins, and multidomain nuclear transcription factors involved in legume root nodulation.	73.0

A SF is a dissociable subunit of RNA polymerase, it directs bacterial or plastid core RNA polymerase to specific promoter elements located upstream of transcription initiation points. The SR4 of Ec sigma70 and other essential primary SFs contact promoter sequences located 35 base-pairs upstream of the initiation point, recognizing a 6-base-pair -35 consensus TTGACA.  Sigma70 related SFs also include SFs which are dispensable for bacterial cell growth for example Ec sigmaS, SFs which activate regulons in response to a specific signal for example heat-shock Ec sigmaH, and a group of SFs which includes the extracytoplasmic function (ECF) SFs and is typified by Ec sigmaE which contains SR2 and -4 only. ECF SFs direct the transcription of genes that regulate various responses including periplasmic stress and pathogenesis.   Ec sigmaE SR4 also contacts the -35 element, but recognizes a different consensus (a 7-base-pair GGAACTT).  Plant SFs recognize sigma70 type promoters and direct transcription of the major plastid RNA polymerase, plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP).	55.0

This short domain consists of a helix-turn-helix structure, which can bind to several types of RNA. It is found in the ribosomal protein S15, the influenza A viral nonstructural protein (NSA) and in several eukaryotic aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRSs), where it occurs as a single or a repeated unit. It is involved in both protein-RNA interactions by binding tRNA and protein-protein interactions in the formation of tRNA-synthetases into multienzyme complexes. While this domain lacks significant sequence similarity between the subgroups in which it is found, they share similar electrostatic surface potentials and thus are likely to bind to RNA via the same mechanism.	46.0

However, compared with that observed in prokaryotic EF-TU, the nucleotide-binding domain (domain I) of mtEF-TU is in a different orientation relative to the rest of the structure. Furthermore, domain III is followed by a short 11-amino acid extension that forms one helical turn.

This family includes the C-terminal cupin domain of (S)-Ureidoglycine aminohydrolase (UGlyAH), an enzyme that converts (S)-ureidoglycine into (S)-ureidoglycolate and ammonia, providing the final substrate to the ureide pathway. The ureide pathway has recently been identified as the metabolic route of purine catabolism in plants and some bacteria where, uric acid, which is a major product of the early stage of purine catabolism, is degraded into glyoxylate and ammonia via stepwise reactions by seven different enzymes. Thus, this pathway has a possible physiological role in mobilization of purine ring nitrogen for further assimilation. This enzyme from Arabidopsis thaliana(AtUGlyAH) has been shown to bind a Mn2+ ion,via the C-terminal cupin domain, which acts as a molecular anchor to bind (S)-ureidoglycine, and its binding mode dictates the enantioselectivity of the reaction. The structure of AtUGlyAH shows a bi-cupin fold with a conserved ""jelly roll-like"" beta-barrel fold and an octameric functional unit. Several structural homologs of UGlyAH, including the Escherichia coli ortholog YlbA (also known as GlxB6), also exhibit similar features."	92.0

This superfamily contains proteins similar to the RmlC (dTDP (deoxythymidine diphosphates)-4-dehydrorhamnose 3,5-epimerase)-like cupins. RmlC is a dTDP-sugar isomerase involved in the synthesis of L-rhamnose, a saccharide required for the virulence of some pathogenic bacteria. Cupins are a functionally diverse superfamily originally discovered based on the highly conserved motif found in germin and germin-like proteins. This conserved motif forms a beta-barrel fold found in all of the cupins, giving rise to the name cupin ('cupa' is the Latin term for small barrel). The active site of members of this superfamily is generally located at the center of a conserved barrel and usually includes a metal ion.

The chaperonins are 'helper' molecules required for correct folding and subsequent assembly of some proteins. These are required for normal cell growth, and are stress-induced, acting to stabilise or protect disassembled polypeptides under heat-shock conditions. Type I chaperonins present in eubacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts require the concerted action of 2 proteins, chaperonin 60 (cpn60) and chaperonin 10 (cpn10). The 10 kDa chaperonin (cpn10 - or groES in bacteria) exists as a ring-shaped oligomer of between six to eight identical subunits, while the 60 kDa chaperonin (cpn60 - or groEL in bacteria) forms a structure comprising 2 stacked rings, each ring containing 7 identical subunits. These ring structures assemble by self-stimulation in the presence of Mg2+-ATP. The central cavity of the cylindrical cpn60 tetradecamer provides as isolated environment for protein folding whilst cpn-10 binds to cpn-60 and synchronizes the release of the folded protein in an Mg2+-ATP dependent manner. The binding of cpn10 to cpn60 inhibits the weak ATPase activity of cpn60.	93.0

It forms heptameric rings with a dome-like structure, forming a lid to the large cavity of the tetradecameric cpn60 cylinder and thereby tightly regulating release and binding of proteins to the cpn60 surface.	93.0
